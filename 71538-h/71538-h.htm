<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
THE DISCOVERY
</h3>

<p>
The Hôtel de Pontivy was situated in the Rue
des Lions-Saint-Paul, in the very heart of the Marais
Quarter, which as early as the opening of this story,
the June of 1775, seemed to form by itself a little
province in Paris.
</p>

<p>
It was a magnificent spring night.  The sky,
luminous with a galaxy of stars, was reflected on
the dark waters of the Seine lazily flowing by.  A
hush rested on the Rue des Lions-Saint-Paul, which
lay enshrouded in gloom and silence, indifferent to
the fairy charms of the hour.
</p>

<p>
Enclosed in high walls thickly clad with ivy,
dark and mysterious as a prison, the Hôtel de
Pontivy had all the aspect of some chill cloister
apart from men and movement.  And yet behind
those shutters, where life seemed to pause, wrapped
in slumber, some one is keeping watch&mdash;the master
of the house, Monsieur Jacques Bernard Olivier de
Pontivy, Councillor to the King's Parliament, sits
late at his work, taking no count of time.
</p>

<p>
But Monsieur de Pontivy has at last decided; he
raises his eyes to the clock.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty past two!" he exclaims.  "I really
cannot wake that poor fellow!"
</p>

<p>
Through the deep stillness of the vast room, with
blinds and curtains drawn, a stillness enhanced by
the glare of candelabra lighted up, as if in broad
day, the heavy, green-repp armchairs, and
bookshelves of massive oak ornamented with brass
rose-work, passing a litter of cardboard boxes and
waste-paper basket, and in the centre the ministerial
desk overladen with books and bundles, the
councillor makes his way towards a bureau that he has
not yet opened.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it may be here," he says, as he turns
over a whole file of letters, old and new, receipts,
accounts, plans and invoices&mdash;one of those mixed
files put aside for future classification.  Perhaps the
paper had been slipped in there by mistake?  Monsieur
de Pontivy set to work methodically, turning
the papers over one by one, stopping here and there
to read a word that caught his attention, or threw a
sudden light on things long forgotten, and awakened
projects long dormant.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I must think over that," he exclaimed, as
he put one or another aside.
</p>

<p>
Now and again a ray of joy lit up his countenance,
as he thought he had found the missing
paper, and as disappointment followed he renewed
the search with unabated ardour.
</p>

<p>
For more than half an hour he went on thus,
seeking the lost document, a lawyer's opinion
recently received, which would assist him in elucidating
a difficult point which was to be secretly debated
the next day in Parliament, before judgment was
delivered.  He had thoughtlessly let his young
secretary retire without asking him the whereabouts of
this document, which he alone could find.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur de Pontivy had hastened to his study
this evening directly dinner was over, to mature in
solitude the arguments which were to triumph on
the morrow, and of which he wished to make a
short, concise summary before retiring to rest.
</p>

<p>
Having returned home sooner than usual that
afternoon, the fancy had seized him to advance the
dinner-hour, but learning that his daughter had not
returned, he was obliged to forego his whim.  This
hour was rarely changed, the regulations of the house
being rigorous to a degree, but Monsieur de Pontivy
in the excess of his despotic authority was none the
less displeased, being early himself, to find no one
awaiting him.  So when he heard the rumbling of
the heavy coach which brought back Clarisse and
her governess, Mademoiselle Jusseaume, he sought
for a pretext to vent his ill-humour on them.
</p>

<p>
He had commenced to walk impatiently backwards
and forwards the whole length of the room,
casting hasty glances out of the window, wondering
at the child's delay in coming to him, when the
door opened and a head appeared in the doorway,
fair, with pale, delicate features, large blue eyes,
wide open to the day, in whose clear depths,
half-hidden by the fresh candour of first youth, lay a
tinge of melancholy.
</p>

<p>
It was Clarisse.
</p>

<p>
What an apparition, in such an austere and
dreary place, that frail, white-robed form standing
on the threshold, a tender smile of dawn in the
dark room!  She entered on tip-toe, approaching
her father with greeting in her eyes and on her
lips; he, continuing his walk, had his back towards
her.
</p>

<p>
"Already here?" she asked, and her voice fell
on the silence like an angelus.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur de Pontivy turned abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"How is it that you enter without knocking?"
</p>

<p>
The smile died on the child's lips.  She
murmured, disconcerted and abashed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I never used to knock, father, on entering
your room."
</p>

<p>
"Then make it a point to do so in future.  You
are no longer a child; so learn to be discreet and to
respect closed doors.  A closed room, mademoiselle,
is a sanctuary."
</p>

<p>
The young girl was accustomed to sermons, but
had not expected one of that kind just then.  She
stood irresolute, hesitating whether to advance or
retire.
</p>

<p>
"Must I go?" she hazarded, trembling.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur de Pontivy, satisfied at having vented
his ill-humour, stooped to kiss his daughter's forehead,
and then added, as if to soften the effects of
his reception&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Where have you been to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"On the boulevards."
</p>

<p>
"Were there many people?"
</p>

<p>
The young girl, reassured by this encouragement,
began brightly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, and only imagine...!"
</p>

<p>
"That will do!  You can tell me that at table."
</p>

<p>
But at table she was supposed only to reply to
her father, and he, lost in meditation, did not
question her that day.  And so passed all the
meals she partook of with her father and young
de Robespierre, Monsieur de Pontivy's secretary,
whom the councillor made welcome every day at
his table, glad to have so near at hand one whose
memory and aid were easily available.
</p>

<p>
Timid at first, confining himself to the points
put to him, the young secretary had gradually
become bolder, and sometimes, to Clarisse's great
delight, would lead the conversation on to subjects of
literature and art, opening out a new world before
her, and shedding rays of thought in her dawning
mind.  She found a similar source of pleasure on
Sundays in the reception-room, while Monsieur de
Pontivy's attention was absorbed by his dull and
solemn friends in interminable games of whist, and
Robespierre entertained her apart, quickening her
young dreams by the charm of an imagination at
once brilliant and graceful.  It was as dew falling
from heaven on her solitude.
</p>

<p>
Alas, how swiftly those hours flew!  Clarisse
was just sixteen.  She could not remember one day
of real joy.  Her mother she had lost long ago;
her brother Jacques, two years younger than herself,
was always at school at the College de Navarre,
and she saw him only once a fortnight, at lunch,
after mass, on Sunday.  At four o'clock an usher
fetched him, when he had submitted his fortnight's
school-work for the inspection of his father, who
more often than not found fault with his efforts, so
that the lad frankly confessed to his sister that, upon
the whole, he preferred those Sundays on which he
remained at school.
</p>

<p>
From her cradle Clarisse had been given over to
nurses and chamber-maids, and at the age of eight
she was confided to the care of nuns, just when she
was emerging from the long torpor of childhood.
Here she remained until the day when Monsieur de
Pontivy, whose paternal solicitude had, up to then,
been limited to taking her to the country for the
holidays, claimed her, and installed her in his town
residence under the charge of a governess.  But
Clarisse had only changed convents.  For going
out but seldom, except to mass and vespers on
Sundays, at St. Paul's Church, or on fine days for a
drive in the great coach with her governess, she
continued to grow like a hot-house plant, closed in
by the high walls of the house where nothing smiled,
not even the garden uncultivated and almost
abandoned, nor the courtyard where a few scattered
weeds pushed their way between the stones.
</p>

<p>
It is true the young girl fully made up for this
in the country, during the summer months at the
Château de Pontivy, two miles from Compiègne,
where her father spent his holidays.  But they were
so short, those precious holidays!  The autumn
roses had scarcely unfolded when she was compelled
to return with her father to Paris; and all the
charm and sweetness of September, with the tender
tints of its dying leaves, were unknown to her, though
a semblance of its grace crept into her room
sometimes in the Rue des Lions-Saint-Paul, and stole
like melancholy into her young soul, but new-awakened
to the ideal, arousing a regret for joys denied.
</p>

<p>
These holidays were shorter since Monsieur de
Pontivy recommenced his duties as councillor to
the Parliament which the King had just re-established,
and Clarisse began again to feel lonely, so
lonely that she looked forward impatiently to the
dinner-hour, when the young secretary brought with
him some gay reports and rumours of Paris, planted
germs of poetry in her soul, and initiated her into
those charming trifles which constitute fashionable
life.
</p>

<p>
All her suppressed tenderness and affection, which
asked nothing better than to overflow, were
concentrated on her governess, Mademoiselle
Jusseaume, an excellent creature, upright and generous,
but impulsive, inconsequent, and without authority.
She was a good Catholic, and saw that her charge
scrupulously observed her religious duties.  She
kept her place, was submissive, discreet, and always
contented; and this was more than enough to satisfy
Monsieur de Pontivy, who classed all womankind
in one rank, and that the lowest.
</p>

<p>
Of his two children the one in whom Monsieur
de Pontivy took the greater interest was his son,
the heir to his name, and to whom would descend
later on the office of councillor.  But as this was
as yet a distant prospect, he contented himself with
superintending his education as much as possible,
absorbed as he was in high functions which he
fulfilled with that perseverance and assiduity, that
desire to give incessant proofs of staunch fidelity,
which arise from an immeasurable pride.
</p>

<p>
Such a character can well be imagined.  Heartless,
hard, and implacable, strictly accomplishing
his duty, honest to a fault, making ever an ostentatious
display of his principles, doing no man harm,
but also suffering no man to harm him, under an
apparent coldness he masked an excess of violence
that the least suspicion or provocation would arouse.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse had her black-letter days&mdash;days of scolding,
when with eyes brimful of tears she retired to
her room, forbidden even to seek refuge with her
governess; and looking back through the mists of
childhood, she endured again those terrible scenes
of anger, the horror of which haunted her still.
</p>

<p>
The two women understood each other instinctively,
almost without the aid of words, living as
they did that sequestered existence, in constant
communion, both losing themselves in the same vague
dreams, trembling on the borders of the unknown;
each leaning on the other, with this only difference
that Clarisse with an indefinable feeling of dawning
force took the lead.
</p>

<p>
The same dim future smiled on both, the same
far-off paradise of delusive hopes in which they
would gladly lose themselves, until Mademoiselle
Jusseaume, suddenly conscious of responsibility,
would rouse herself, blushing and trembling, as if
at some guilty thought.  For in their day-dreams
Monsieur de Pontivy had no part, did not exist.
Was he to disappear?  Was he to die?  In any
case he was always absent from these speculations,
and Mademoiselle Jusseaume, the soul of righteousness,
felt that this was altogether wrong.
</p>

<p>
"You must love your father," she would say, as
if stirred by some secret impulse, and the remark
fell suddenly and unexpectedly on the silence of the
little room where the two were apparently deeply
absorbed in the mazy dancing of the flies.
</p>

<p>
"But I do love him!" Clarisse would answer
without surprise, as if replying to some inner
thought.
</p>

<p>
She was, indeed, convinced of it, poor child!
Filial love beamed in her eyes, love for her father:
a mixture of respect for his age and position, and of
gratitude for his rare kindnesses, while he did not
realise the gulf that separated him from his daughter,
a gulf which a little tenderness, an occasional
response, a smile however slight, might have sufficed
to bridge.  He did not realise the riches of this
mine, or seek its treasures of youth, of grace, and
of love abounding in every vein.  He had but
to bend down, look into her large blue eyes, those
eyes where the dreams floated, to find a world of
love.
</p>

<p>
However, he had other things to think about;
Monsieur de Pontivy, King's Councillor to the
ancient Parliament, and unanimously returned to
the new; a man of position, rich, influential, highly
connected, of the old provincial noblesse, admitted
to the council of the King, honoured at Court,
respected in the town, feared at home by a whole
crowd of cringing lackeys trembling before this
potentate of fortune and intellect, who seemed to
them the very embodiment of justice.  His daughter,
indeed!  He had three years before him to think of
her, which meant in his acceptance of the term but
a speedy riddance of her, to his own and her best
advantage, a chance to establish her well in the
world in which he moved, in which his position
would enable him to procure for her without much
difficulty an alliance worthy of her name and rank.
Meanwhile he was happy, or rather contented with
his lot.  Had not the young King but lately said to
him, when he was admitted to a private audience to
render homage and tender his assurances of fidelity
and respect to the successor of Louis XV.:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur de Pontivy, I know the services you
have rendered to France, and I can only ask you to
continue them."
</p>

<p>
These words had spread through Versailles.  The
Councillor was overwhelmed with compliments of
the kind more acceptable to certain natures for the
spice of envy they contain, for is not the envy of
our fellows the very sign and seal of our success?
</p>

<p>
Thus the influential Abbé de Saint-Vaast, the
future Cardinal de Rohan, remarked to him some
days after, whilst walking in the suite of the Queen
at Versailles, "Such words, Monsieur de Pontivy,
stand you in better stead than sealed parchment."
</p>

<p>
A smile of superiority, which he quickly changed
to one of patronising condescension, played round
the Councillor's lips at the thought that for a Rohan
to compliment him meant that he sought something
in return.  Monsieur de Pontivy was not mistaken.
The Abbé de Saint-Vaast wished to place with some
lawyer in search of a secretary a young man who,
having finished his college studies, intended to
prepare for the Bar.
</p>

<p>
"I can recommend him," said the Abbé, "as
intelligent, industrious, and of an excellent character;
one of the best pupils of Louis-le-Grand, and
recently chosen as most worthy the honour of
welcoming the King and Queen, who visited the
college on their way to the Pantheon."
</p>

<p>
"And his name?" asked Monsieur de Pontivy.
</p>

<p>
"Maximilien de Robespierre."
</p>

<p>
"And may I ask your lordship's reason for the
particular interest taken in this young man?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes, of course!  He comes from Arras,
and was commended to me by the bishop of that
town, with excellent testimonials from a priest of
my diocese.  I gave him a grant for the college,
and as he has succeeded so far, I shall be glad to
see him make his way.  And, after all, are we not
generally interested in the welfare of those we have
helped&mdash;a feeling which you doubtless understand,
Monsieur de Pontivy, since it is but human?"
</p>

<p>
"I understand it so well that I will take your
nominee."
</p>

<p>
"Into your own service?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, into my service.  Pray do not thank me.
I was in urgent need of one, and am too glad to
accept him on your recommendation."
</p>

<p>
It was true, for Monsieur de Pontivy with his
manifold occupations was at the moment without a
secretary, and anxious to fill up the post so soon as
he could find a worthy candidate.  The offer of the
Abbé was doubly acceptable to him as an opportunity
to oblige a Rohan, and to enlist in his service a
young man who had been chosen before all his
fellow-students as most worthy to welcome the
King and Queen.
</p>

<p>
The next day Robespierre was installed at the
Hôtel de Pontivy.  After some preliminary questions
as to his parentage, his studies, his college life,
Monsieur de Pontivy had adroitly brought the
conversation to bear on the visit of Louis XVI. and
Marie Antoinette.  The young man gave a detailed
account, standing in a respectful attitude, his
eyes lowered, and with an appearance of modesty,
which to a mind less vain than that of Monsieur
de Pontivy's would have suggested more
self-sufficiency than was desirable.
</p>

<p>
"And the King, what did he say?  And the Queen?"
</p>

<p>
"Their majesties did not speak to me," said the
young man, rather confused.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" exclaimed Monsieur de Pontivy, visibly
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"But the King smiled," continued Robespierre,
"and received me graciously."
</p>

<p>
"And the Queen?"
</p>

<p>
The young man hesitated, but drawing himself
up resolutely under the searching glance of the
Councillor, he answered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Her Majesty was equally gracious."
</p>

<p>
But he was not telling the truth, for the Queen's
thoughts had been bent all the time on hastening
her departure.  Monsieur de Pontivy examined the
young man critically.  He was dressed with the
utmost simplicity, but a certain air of distinction
was apparent in his whole person and manners.
Spruce and neat in appearance, sprightly and brisk
in manner, and at the same time respectful, decision
of character and firm will were written on his brow;
his eyes of a pale green were restless and piercing,
though their gleam under the gaze of others was
veiled, and so subdued as to lend to the whole
countenance an unexpected tenderness.
</p>

<p>
"The young man is not so bad after all," mused
Monsieur de Pontivy, and he thought he was justified
in admitting him to his table now and again.
Had he not been honoured with a royal glance?
He could by no means be looked upon as a chance
comer.
</p>

<p>
A chance comer he certainly was not, as Monsieur
de Pontivy soon discovered by his work, quick, neat,
perfectly accurate and orderly, and his method in
arrangement and classification, rare in a young man
of his years.  Pursuing his law studies, he was
naturally interested in the difficult and delicate
questions which Monsieur de Pontivy had so often to
treat, elucidating them under his direction, and
astonishing him sometimes by his sagacious remarks,
in which were revealed a rare instinct for solving
legal subtleties.
</p>

<p>
There is a certain kinship of the mind, a certain
intellectual affinity, which creates sympathy between
those who may be separated by a wide social gulf.
They certainly were so separated, this master and
his secretary: the one jealously asserting his
prerogative, proud of his name, of that <i>noblesse de robe</i>
of which he was one of the ornaments, and which,
seeing its growing influence on the destinies of
France, he had exalted to the highest rank; the
other of doubtful origin, hesitating even to make
use of the titular prefix of nobility, but shrewd and
ambitious, and seeking to supply his deficiencies of
birth in the reflected light of the patrician world.
</p>

<p>
For, after all, who were the <i>de</i> Robespierres?
The tangled narrative of the young man had but
half satisfied Monsieur de Pontivy.  There was,
first and foremost, his father, who left his four
children, when mad with grief at the loss of his
wife, and disappeared in Germany in most
mysterious fashion.  But was young Robespierre
responsible for all this misty past?
</p>

<p>
That which pleased Monsieur de Pontivy most
in his young secretary were his orderly habits and
his method of classifying and arranging everything
to hand.  So continuing that evening to look for
the report he wanted, he had hesitated to wake
him.  He had seemed so sleepy before going to
bed, and it was the first time a document had not
been forthcoming.  The Councillor had looked
everywhere&mdash;on the files, under the blotters, and
even in the waste-paper basket.  Had the young
fellow thrown it in the fire by mistake?  Naturally
distrustful, suspicions began gradually to form in his
mind.  Had Robespierre made use of it?  Had he
given it to an attorney?  Once doubting Monsieur
de Pontivy did not rest.  Had he sold it?  Yes,
perhaps sold it to the counsel for the adverse party!
Everything is possible!  One is never sure....  At
any rate he would ease his mind and ascertain at
once.  Monsieur de Pontivy looked at his watch.
</p>

<p>
"Three o'clock!  So you have kept me up till
this hour, my fine fellow!  Now it is your turn!"
</p>

<p>
He took down a candlestick, lighted it at one
of the chandeliers, and went towards the door.
The whole house was wrapped in sleep.  Oh! the
awful stillness of that vast house, where not a soul
seemed to breathe, that house with its interminable
corridors, so high and so cold, like long, deserted
lanes.  Thus alone, in the silence of the night, he
experienced a new sense of satisfaction, for was not
the house absolutely his?  Every living occupant,
man or beast, was at his bidding, under his sway;
and at this hour, when all slept under his
protection, his proprietorship was accentuated, and he
realised to the full that he was absolute master.  In
his long flowered dressing-gown, holding the candlestick
aloft in his right hand, with his iron-grey head,
clean-shaven visage, and true judge's nose, large and
massive as if hewn in one piece, and in keeping
with the cold, hard expression of his countenance,
he could have been taken for the spirit of avenging
justice, or for some statue, descended from its
pedestal to carry light into the surrounding darkness.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur de Pontivy crossed a long passage,
turned to the left, then went up three steps, and
turning again, found himself on a narrow staircase
leading to the second floor.  It was there that the
young secretary slept, in a little room looking on
the courtyard.  He lifted the candle to assure
himself he was not mistaken, then knocked softly, twice.
Receiving no answer he knocked again, somewhat
louder.
</p>

<p>
"He sleeps soundly enough," he muttered; "at
that age it comes easy."
</p>

<p>
The Councillor was on the point of returning.
After all, it would be time enough to speak of the
paper at breakfast, and already day was beginning
to break.  But again those subtle, insinuating
suspicions crept into his mind.  Yes! he must assure
himself at once!  And he knocked again, this time
almost pushing the door.  It was not fastened, and
gave way, disclosing an empty room and a bed
untouched.  With a rapid glance he searched the
room.  All was in order.
</p>

<p>
"What!" he exclaimed, "at his age!  This is
promising, certainly."
</p>

<p>
And he began to wonder which servant was
accessory to these midnight rambles, for this was
surely not the first.  The hall door was barred and
double-barred when young Robespierre took leave
of Monsieur de Pontivy.  The porter was certainly
culpable.  Yes, the whole domestic staff was privy
to the misconduct of his secretary!  The very next
day the Councillor would have a reckoning with them
all, and it would be a terrible reckoning!  But
just at that moment, when Monsieur de Pontivy was
about to leave the room, he noticed the young man's
hat and stick lying near.  He stopped in surprise.
</p>

<p>
Was Robespierre in the house, then?
</p>

<p>
Monsieur de Pontivy again looked at the bed.
No, it had not been slept in.  Other details struck
him: the coat and vest hanging up, and the frilled
waistcoat carefully folded on a chair.  It was
enough,&mdash;the young man had not gone out.
</p>

<p>
Where was he?  In Louison's room, undoubtedly,
on the third floor!  Louison, his daughter's
maid!  She was from Perigord, sprightly and
complaisant, cunning enough, a veritable <i>soubrette</i>, with
her sly ways and her round cheeks.  Ah! how
stupid he had been to have taken her into the house,
considering her age and bearing, scarcely twenty-two,
and dark and passionate as a Catalonian.
</p>

<p>
"I ought to have known as much," he said.
</p>

<p>
His daughter's waiting-woman!  The thought
was distracting.  That she should enter Clarisse's
room every morning, carry her breakfast, see her
in bed, assist at each detail of her toilet, fresh from
the young man's embraces, his caresses still warm
on her lips!  And these things were taking place
under his roof!
</p>

<p>
He left the room agitated but resolved.  It was
very simple.  To-morrow she would be discharged
the first thing, and he also should be turned out,
the hypocrite who, with all his smiling, respectful
airs, defiled his roof.  He did well to get himself
protected by priests, and Monsieur de Rohan, a
nice present he had made!
</p>

<p>
All the young man's qualities, all the satisfaction
he had given him, disappeared before this one brutal
fact.  He would not be sorry, either, to be able to
say to the Abbé de Saint-Vaast&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You know the young man you recommended
me.  Well, I surprised him in the garret with a
servant-maid, and I turned him out like a lackey.
But even lackeys respect my house."
</p>

<p>
He had now crossed the corridor and was descending
the stairs, still rehearsing the scene in
his mind.  Smarting under his wounded self-love,
he exaggerated everything.  Had they not forgotten
the respect due to him, Monsieur de Pontivy, to
his house, and worse still, had they not mockingly
set him at defiance?  He smiled grimly at the
thought.  He had now reached the last step of the
second staircase, and was turning into the corridor
of the ground floor.
</p>

<p>
"Decidedly," he muttered, "I was mistaken in
my estimate of that young man.  He is a fool!"
</p>

<p>
All at once he stopped.  He caught the sound
of whispering, and the noise of a door being softly
and cautiously closed.  Some one here, at this
hour!  Who can it be?  He blew out the candle,
and gliding along the wall, he approached, but
suddenly recoiled, for in the grey light of the dawn he
had recognised Robespierre.  The young man was
advancing quietly in the direction of the stairs.
</p>

<p>
The truth, all the awful, maddening truth, the
endless shame and dishonour, rushed on Monsieur de
Pontivy in a moment, and stunned him like a blow.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had come from Clarisse's room!
</p>

<p>
Everything swam before him.  He held in his
hand the extinguished candle, with such force that
the bronze candlestick entered his flesh.  He made
a movement as if to use it as a weapon, and kill
the wretch there and then.  At that instant the
young man saw him.  He turned deadly pale and
tried to escape, but Monsieur de Pontivy threw
himself on him, and seized him by the throat.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you come from?" he almost hissed.
</p>

<p>
The young man swayed with the shock, his knees,
bent under him.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur de Pontivy, mad with rage, repeated&mdash;"Where
do you come from?"
</p>

<p>
He was strangling him.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre gave a hoarse scream.
</p>

<p>
"You are hurting me!" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Hurting you!  Hurting you! did you say?
What if I kill you, knock out your cursed brains
with this"&mdash;brandishing the bronze candlestick&mdash;"yes,
kill you, wretch, for bringing dishonour on
my house...."
</p>

<p>
But just then Monsieur de Pontivy felt a hand
laid on his arm arresting the blow.
</p>

<p>
It was Clarisse, drawn by the noise, half-dressed,
her hair hanging in disorder down her back.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father!" she sobbed, falling on her knees,
as if for pardon.
</p>

<p>
It was dishonour, yes, dishonour complete,
palpable, avowed, dishonour that flowed with his.
daughter's tears, and covered her face with shame.
The agony of the father was augmented by that of
the head of the family, whose record of austerity and
uprightness was thus dragged in the mud.
</p>

<p>
The young man, having regained his self-possession,
was about to speak, but Monsieur de Pontivy
gave him no time.
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" he thundered.  "Not a word!  Do
you hear, sir?  Not a word!  To your room, and
await my orders!"
</p>

<p>
The command was accompanied with such a
gesture that Robespierre could only obey, and
silently moved towards the staircase.
</p>

<p>
Then, turning towards Clarisse, he continued,
"As to you ..."
</p>

<p>
But she lay lifeless on the floor.  He bent down,
lifted her in his arms, and carried her to her room;
exhausted by her weight, he laid her on the first
armchair.
</p>

<p>
The young girl regained consciousness.  She
opened her eyes and recognised her father, and a
sob rose in her throat, suffocating her.  She could
not speak, but a word she had not pronounced for
ten years, a word from her far-off childhood, came
to her lips, and she murmured softly through her
tears, "Papa! papa!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
THE VOICE OF THE PAST
</h3>

<p>
Under what irresistible spell had she fallen?
Through what intricate windings had the subtle
poison entered the young girl's pure and innocent
soul, then steeped in the fresh dew of life's dawning
hopes?  What sweet vision had the young man
held out to her, to which she had yielded in all
innocence, her eyes dreamily fixed on the vague
unknown, and from which she had awaked, all pale
and trembling, her heart smitten with unspeakable dismay?
</p>

<p>
Or had they both been the puppets of Destiny, of
blind Chance which at so tender an age had brought
them together under the same roof, in an intimacy
of daily intercourse, increased by the sadness of their
cloistered existence, so that they had been the
victims of their extreme youth, of the attraction they
unconsciously exercised over each other, both carried
away by the strong currents of life.
</p>

<p>
She, influenced by a train of incidents insignificant
in themselves, rendered dangerous by repetition,
details of every-day life which had gradually drawn her
towards the young man, whose presence at last
became a sweet necessity to her lonely existence.
</p>

<p>
He, suddenly stirred during the first few days of
his residence in the Hôtel Rue des Lions; never for
a moment thinking of the distance which separated
him from the daughter of Monsieur de Pontivy.
Think?  How could he think, thrilling under the
first revelation of love disclosed to him with the
eloquence of Rousseau in <i>la Nouvelle Héloïse</i>, that
romance of burning passion then in vogue?  He
had commenced to read the novel, by stealth, at
Louis-le-Grand, and finished it in three nights of
mad insomnia, in his little room on the third floor at
the Hôtel de Pontivy.  All the sap of his youth beat
at his temples and throbbed in his veins at that flaming
rhetoric; every phrase burned like kisses on his lips.
</p>

<p>
He recited portions aloud, learned them by heart,
found them sublime in utterance.  He yearned to
repeat them to others, as one does music.  And to
whom could he repeat them but to Clarisse, placed
there as if expressly to hear them?  So he did
repeat them to her.  At all times and everywhere
when alone with her.  At the harpsichord, on long
winter evenings, when the guests gravely and silently
played at cards, and he turned the pages of her
music.  Out walking, when he met her, as if by
chance, and spoke to her&mdash;while the eyes of
Mademoiselle Jusseaume wandered absently from
them&mdash;of Paris which she knew so little, the gay
<i>fêtes</i> and gossip of the town, thus opening out to her
endless vistas of happiness until then unknown,
which involved promises of future joy.
</p>

<p>
He recited verses to her, pastorals, such as were
then upon men's lips, mythologic madrigals made
for rolling round a bonbon.  She found them
charming, and sought to learn them by heart.  He
copied them and gave them to her.  This was a
dangerous game.  He became bolder, copied
love-letters, then wrote them himself and compared them
with Rousseau's.  She read them, delighted at first,
then trembling, and when she trembled it was too
late.
</p>

<p>
She was unconsciously dragged into a world of
fancy and illusion by the very strength of his youth
and enthusiasm.  His presence in that dull dwelling
had seemed a ray of sunlight under which the bud
of her young life had opened into flower.  Thus,
all unconscious of the poisonous mist that was more
closely enveloping her from day to day, she found
herself gliding insensibly down a steep declivity which
gave way under her feet as she advanced, and before
she could recover possession of her senses, or stay
her quick descent to question whereto it led, she was
undone!
</p>

<p>
"Every girl who reads this book is lost," Rousseau
had written at the beginning of la Nouvelle
Héloïse.  And she had done far worse.  Alone,
given up to her own devices, just awakening to the
mystery of existence, pure, innocent, and guileless,
she had imbibed its insidious poison from the lips of
one she had learned to love.  And now she had
fallen from these dizzy heights, dazed and crushed,
lonelier than ever, for Monsieur de Pontivy had
turned Robespierre out of the house soon after the
fatal discovery.
</p>

<p>
The decision had been brief, in the character of a
command:
</p>

<p>
"Of course, it is understood that what passed
between us last night shall go no further," Monsieur
de Pontivy had said to the young secretary, called to
the Councillor's study at breakfast-time.  "You
can seek some pretext to treat me disrespectfully at
table before the servants, and I shall beg you to
leave my house."
</p>

<p>
The young man listened respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"But I am willing to make reparation," he said.
</p>

<p>
The Councillor drew back under this new affront.
</p>

<p>
"You marry my daughter!  You forget who you
are, Monsieur de Robespierre!  You, the husband
of Mademoiselle de Pontivy!  Enough, sir, and do
as I have said!"
</p>

<p>
The departure of young Robespierre took place
as the Councillor desired.  No one had the slightest
suspicion of the real reason, and Clarisse, who was
suffering from a severe attack of brain fever, kept
her bed.
</p>

<p>
In refusing to give the hand of his daughter, even
dishonoured, to any one who was not of her rank,
Monsieur de Pontivy was but true to his principles,
to his own code of morals, based upon caste prejudice
and foolish pride.
</p>

<p>
Could he have read the future of the young man
he would not have acted otherwise, and yet that
young man was destined to become one of the masters
of France&mdash;but at what a price and under what
conditions!
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Nineteen years had passed since then, nineteen
years in which events succeeded each other with a
rapidity and violence unparalleled in the previous
history of Europe.  The excesses of an arbitrary
government, added to universal discontent, had led
to the Revolution.  But this act of deliverance and
social regeneration was unhappily to develop even
worse excesses.  The Reign of Terror was now
raging.  Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette had
perished on the scaffold, followed by a large number
of nobles and priests, victims of the tempest now at
flood, and drowning in its crimson tide numberless
victims with no respect of persons.  The whole
nation, in the country and in Paris, was perishing in
the iron grasp of a new and more despotic government.
Terror, monstrous parody of liberty, ruled
the State, which was adrift without rudder on the
storm, while all its people were driven to distraction
by wild advocates of the guillotine.
</p>

<p>
Prominent among these fanatics, raised to power
by the very suddenness of events, was Maximilien
de Robespierre, once the young secretary of
Monsieur de Pontivy, now styled simply Robespierre,
President of the National Assembly, or Convention,
the most powerful and most dreaded of the twelve
conventionnels who, under the name of members of
the Committee of Public Safety, ruled the destinies
of France.
</p>

<p>
History is the romance of nations, more abundant
in wild improbabilities than the most extravagant
fairy tale; and the French Revolution stands out
from the events which have perplexed the mind of
man since the world began, a still unsolved enigma.
The actors in this fearful drama move like beings of
some other sphere, the produce of a wild imagination,
the offspring of delirium, created to astound and
stupefy.  And it was the destiny of the secretary of
Monsieur de Pontivy to become one of these.  Still
in the prime of his life, scarcely thirty-six, he was
one of the principal if not the chief personage of the
Revolution.
</p>

<p>
However signal his success, the course of events
left him unchanged.  During the slow accession of
a man to the summit of human aspiration, his
deficiences are sometimes dwarfed and his powers
developed and strengthened; but the foundation remains
the same&mdash;just as trees which ever renew their
leaves, and absorb from the same soil a perennial
flow of life.
</p>

<p>
After nineteen years, marked by a succession of
events so rapid, so tumultuous, and of such moment
that they would have sufficed to fill a century of
history, the secretary of Monsieur de Pontivy, whom
we last saw awake to love under the influence of
Rousseau, found himself, on a day given up to
retirement and study, at <i>l'Ermitage</i> of Montmorency,
in the very room where the great philosopher wrote
<i>la Nouvelle Héloïse</i>, whose burning pages had been a
revelation to his youth.
</p>

<p>
He had come there to seek inspiration for the
speech he was to deliver on the Place de la Révolution
at the approaching festival in honour of the Supreme
Being, a ceremony instituted and organised
under his direction, and which had been suggested
to him by the spiritualistic theories of Rousseau.
</p>

<p>
It was Friday, the 6th of June, 1794, or, to use
the language of the time, the 20th <i>prairial</i> of the
second year of the Republic.  Robespierre, having
left Paris the evening before, had come down to
sleep in that quiet and flowery retreat, built at the
entrance of the forest of Montmorency, like a nest
hidden in the under branches of a tree.  Rousseau's
<i>Ermitage</i>, which became State property after the
Revolution, had been secretly sublet to him by a
friend and given over to the care of a gardener,
who also acted as sole domestic during his visits,
which were very frequent.  For he often fled from
Paris secretly, seeking solitude and calm, and a little
of that poetry of nature in which the fiercest
Revolutionists, his peers in crime, loved sometimes to
refresh themselves in the short pauses of their
fratricidal and sanguinary struggles.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre descended to the garden soon after
daybreak, inhaling the fresh morning air, wandering
under the shade of those great trees where
Rousseau used to walk, or sitting in his favourite
nooks; dreaming the while, his soul drinking to
the full the infinite sweetness of Nature's magic
charms, quickened into life at the rosy touch of
morn.  He would busy himself in rustic pursuits,
botanising, or gathering periwinkles, the master's
favourite flowers; thus occupied he used to
prolong his walk into the forest of Montmorency,
which seemed but a continuation of the garden.
Here, he would sometimes find friends awaiting
him, an intimate circle which he was wont to
gather round him to share a rustic meal upon
the grass.
</p>

<p>
That morning he had awakened earlier than
usual, beset with ideas for his forthcoming speech,
the first that he was to deliver at a public
ceremony, whose anticipated success would, like an
apotheosis, deify him in the eyes of the people, and
set a decisive and brilliant seal to that supremacy
of power which was the goal of his boundless
ambition.  It was important that he should finish
before noon, when he had arranged an interview
in the forest, a political interview of the highest
importance, which would perhaps effect a change
in the foreign policy of France.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had slept in the very room which
Rousseau had occupied on the first floor, and in
which were gathered all the furniture and possessions
of the great man, left behind in the haste of
removal, after his famous quarrel with the fair
owner of <i>l'Ermitage</i>.  The bed was Rousseau's, as
were two walnut cabinets and a table of the same
rich wood, the very table on which the philosopher
wrote the first part of <i>la Nouvelle Hèloïse</i>; then a
small library, a barometer, and two pictures, one of
which, by an English painter, represented "The
Soldier's Fortune," and the other "The Wise and
Foolish Virgins."  In these surroundings Robespierre
seemed to breathe more intimately the spirit
of the master for whom he had such an ardent admiration.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had passed a sleepless night, judging
from his pale, feverish face and swollen eyelids.
Outwardly he was little changed.  Monsieur de
Pontivy would have recognised his former secretary
in this man before whom all France trembled.  It
was the same dapper figure, spruce and neat as ever,
with that nervous, restless manner which time had
but accentuated.  This nervousness, apparent in his
whole person, was visible even in his face, which,
now deeply marked with small-pox, twitched and
contracted convulsively.  The high cheek-bones and
the green, cat-like eyes, shifting about in an uneasy
fashion, added to the unpleasant expression of the
whole countenance.
</p>

<p>
He threw open the three windows of his room,
which looked out on the garden.  A whiff of fresh
air fanned his face, charged with all the sweet
perfumes of the country.  Day had scarcely dawned,
and the whole valley of Montmorency was bathed
in pale, uncertain light, like floating mist.  He
remained at one of the windows, gazing long and
earnestly out on awakening nature, watching the
dawn as it slowly lifted the veil at the first smiles of
morning.  Then he seated himself at the little table
prepared for work, with sheets of paper spread about,
as if awaiting the thoughts of which they were to be
the messengers.  He slipped his pen in an inkstand
ornamented with a small bust of Rousseau, and commenced.
</p>

<p>
Jotting down some rough notes and sentences, he
stopped to look out of the window in a dreamy,
absent manner, apparently without thought.  Thirty-five
years ago, amid the same surroundings, in that
same room, on that very table, Rousseau had written
those burning pages of romance under whose
influence Robespierre had stammered forth his first
love tale on the shoulder of Clarisse.  Did he ever
think of that drama of his youth, of that living relic
of his sin wandering about the world perhaps, his
child, the fruit of his first love, whose advent into
life Clarisse had announced to him some months
after the terrible scene at the Rue des Lions-Saint-Paul?
Think?  He had more important things to
trouble him!  Think indeed!  The idea had never
entered his head.  For many years the intellectual
appetite had alone prevailed in him;&mdash;egoism, and
that masterful ambition which asks no other intoxicant
than the delirium of success, and the thought
of realising one day, by terrorism even if necessary,
Utopian theories of universal equality.  And yet
the letter in which Clarisse had apprised him of her
approaching motherhood would have moved a stone:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR MAXIMILIEN,&mdash;I never thought to write
to you after the solemn promise torn from me by
my father, the day he declared I should never be
your wife.  An unexpected event releases me from
my oath, and brings me nearer to you.
</p>

<p>
"I am about to become a mother.
</p>

<p>
"My father knows this.  I thought that the
announcement would conquer his resistance, but I
was mistaken.  My supplications were vain.
</p>

<p>
"He persists unshaken in his refusal, exasperated
at my entreaties, and is resolved to send me to a
convent, where the innocent being whose life is
already considered a crime will first see the light.
My heart bleeds at the thought of the wide gulf
that must separate you from your child, orphaned
before its birth.  And what pain for you to have a
child that you must never know!  But I will spare
you this.  You are the disposer of our destiny,
Maximilien.  We are yours.
</p>

<p>
"I have some money saved, which, in addition
to the kind help of Mademoiselle Jusseaume, would
enable us to cross to England, where a priest of our
faith will bless our union.  We can return afterwards
to France, if you wish; that shall be as you
judge best, for you will have no wife more submissive
and devoted than the mother of your child.
</p>

<p>
"I am sending this letter to your aunt's at Arras,
requesting them to forward it to you.  Write to
me at the Poste Restante, Rue du Louvre, under
the name of the kind-hearted Mademoiselle
Jusseaume, who is reading over my shoulder while I
write, her eyes full of tears.  Wherever I may be,
your reply will always reach me.
</p>

<p>
"I kiss thee from my soul, dear companion of my
heart&mdash;that heart which through all its sufferings
burns with an undying love and is thine forever.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"CLARISSE DE PONTIVY."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This letter remained unanswered.  Had it reached
its destination?  Yes; young Robespierre had actually
received it, eight days after, in Paris, at the
Hôtel du Coq d'Argent, on the Quai des Grands-Augustins,
where he had hired a room after leaving
Monsieur de Pontivy's house.  He had read and
re-read Clarisse's letter, then, on consideration, he
burnt it, so that no trace of it should be left.
Clarisse's proposal was a risky adventure.  What would
become of them both in England when her meagre
resources were exhausted?  Return to France?  Implore
Monsieur de Pontivy's pardon?  A fine prospect!  He
would cause the marriage to be annulled, for it was
illegal both in England and in France, as the young
people were not of age.  As to him, his fate was
sealed in advance.  He would be sent to the Bastille.
And the child?  He scarcely gave a thought to it.
So much might happen before its birth!
</p>

<p>
This, however, was made known to him, soon
after, in another letter from Clarisse.  The
child&mdash;a boy&mdash;was born.  If he did not decide to take
them the child would be abandoned, and she sent
to a convent.  Robespierre hesitated, crushing the
letter between his fingers, then resolutely burnt it,
as he destroyed the first.  Paugh!  The grandfather
was wealthy.  The child would not starve.
Clarisse had told him that she had given him
Monsieur de Pontivy's Christian name&mdash;Olivier.  The
Councillor would eventually relent.  And was it
not, after all, one of those adventures of common
occurrence in the life of young men?  He, at least,
had done his duty by offering to make reparation by
marriage.  Monsieur de Pontivy would not hear of
it.  So much the worse!
</p>

<p>
Ah! he was of mean birth, was he!&mdash;without
ancestry, without connections, without a future....
Without a future?  Was that certain, though?
</p>

<p>
Monsieur de Pontivy's refusal, far from humiliating
him, gave a spur to his ambition.  All his
latent self-esteem and pride rose suddenly in one
violent outburst.  Full of bitterness and wounded
vanity he finished his law studies in a sort of rage,
and set out for Arras, his native place, which he
had left as a child, returning to it a full-fledged
lawyer.  No sooner was he called to the Bar than
he came into public notice, choosing the cases most
likely to bring him renown.
</p>

<p>
But these local triumphs, however flattering,
only half-satisfied his ambition.  He cared little
or nothing for provincial fame.  He would be also
foremost in the ranks of those who followed with
anxious interest the great Revolutionary movement
now astir everywhere, in the highways and byways
of France, with its train of new ideas and aspirations.
Robespierre took part in this cautiously and adroitly,
reserving ample margin for retreat in case of future
surprises, but already foreseeing the brilliant career
that politics would thenceforth offer to ambition.
</p>

<p>
At the Convocation of the States-General, the
young lawyer was sent to Versailles to represent
his native town.  Success was, at length, within
his grasp.  He was nearing the Court, and about
to plunge into the whirl of public affairs, in which
he thought to find an avenue to his ambition.
</p>

<p>
And yet he did not succeed all at once.
Disconcerted, he lost command of himself, became
impatient and excited by extreme nervousness.  He
had developed such tendencies even at Arras, and
time seemed only to increase them.  In the chamber
of the States-General, still ringing with the
thunderous eloquence of Mirabeau, the scene of giant
contests of men of towering mental stature, Robespierre
vainly essayed to speak.  He was received with
mockery and smiles of ridicule.  He appeared puny
and grotesque to these colossal champions of Liberty,
with his falsetto voice, his petty gestures, his nervous
twitches and grimaces, more like a monkey who had
lost a nut than a man.
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre's colleagues would have ceased
their raillery perhaps had they gone deeper into the
motives and character of the man, and sounded the
subtle intricacies of his soul.  They would have
found in those depths a resolute desire to accomplish
his aim, an insatiable pride joined to the confidence
of an apostle determined to uphold his own doctrines,
and to promote theories of absolute equality, and of
a return to the ideal state of nature.  They would
have perhaps discovered that this ambitious fanatic
was capable of anything, even of atrocious crime, to
realise his dreams.
</p>

<p>
The impetuous tribune Mirabeau had said at
Versailles: "That man will go far, for he believes
in what he says."  Mirabeau ought to have said,
"He believes in himself, and, as the effect of his
mad vanity, he looks upon everything he says as
gospel truth."  And in this lay his very strength.
This was the source of his success, founded on that
cult of self, and a confidence in his own powers
carried to the point of believing himself infallible.
Through all the jolts and jars of party strife, the
thunder and lightning contests, the eager enthusiasm
or gloomy despondency, the grand and tumultuous
outpourings of the revolutionary volcano through all
this hideous but sublime conflict, and amid dissensions
of parties swarming from the four corners of
France, tearing each other to pieces like wild beasts,
Robespierre cunningly pursued a stealthy course,
sinuously ingratiating himself now with the more
advanced, now with the more moderate, always
faithful to his original plan and policy.
</p>

<p>
Words!  Rhetoric! these were his arms.  Speech
was not incriminating, but actions were.  Words
were forgotten, actions lived as facts, and Robespierre
kept as clear of these as possible.  During
the most startling manifestations of that horrible
revolutionary struggle, he was never seen, though the
work of his hand could be traced everywhere, for far
from retiring he carried fuel to the flames, knowing
well that every one would be swallowed up in the
fratricidal strife.  When the danger was over and
victory assured, he would re-appear fierce and agitated,
thus creating the illusion that he had taken part in the
last battle, and suffered personally in the contest.
</p>

<p>
Where was he at the insurrection of Paris, the
10th of August, 1792, when the populace invaded
the Tuileries, and hastened the fall and imprisonment
of the King, whom they sent to the scaffold
some months later?  Where was he a few days
later, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of September, when
armed bands wandered through Paris, forcing the
prison doors, and butchering the hostages?  Where
was he during the riots of February, 1793, when
the famished populace prowled about Paris asking
for bread?  Where was he the evening of the 1st
of May, when eighteen thousand Parisians assailed
the National Convention to turn out the traitor
deputies?  Where was he two days after, on the
2nd of June, when the insurrection recommenced?
</p>

<p>
Hidden, immured, barricaded, walking to and fro
like an encaged tiger-cat, excited and agitated, shaken
with doubts, cold beads of perspiration standing on
his forehead, breathless to hear any news which his
agents and detectives might bring him, and only
breathing freely again when the result was known.
</p>

<p>
For this man was a coward.  And was this
known?  No!  Not then!  All that was known
was what he wished to make public; that he was
poor, that he was worthy in every respect of the title
of "Incorruptible" given to him by a revolutionist
in a moment of enthusiasm.  And, in truth, he was
free from any venal stain, and knew that in this lay
the greater part of his strength.
</p>

<p>
What was also known was that he was temperate
and chaste.  His private life, from the time he left
Versailles with the States-General to come to Paris
and install himself in a humble lodging in the Rue
de Saintonge, would bear the closest scrutiny.  He
lived there frugally and modestly, his only resource
being the deputy's fees of eighteen francs a day, part
of which he ostentatiously sent to his sister at Arras.
Then suddenly he established himself in the house
of Duplay the carpenter, in the Rue Saint-Honoré,
a few steps from his club, the Jacobin Club; or,
more properly speaking, he was established there by
force, by the carpenter himself, an ardent admirer of
his, who took advantage of a chance hospitality
during the riots to press him to remain indefinitely.
He occupied a room under their roof where he had
now lived a year, surrounded by the jealous care of
the whole family, in republican simplicity, after the
true patriarchal manner.
</p>

<p>
All this was well known, or if it had not been
Robespierre would have proclaimed it, for from this
Spartan setting an atmosphere of democratic virtue
enveloped him, and raised him in solitary state above
his fellows.
</p>

<p>
Yes, he was above them!  Others gave themselves
away, but he never!  Others had revealed
their characters in unguarded moments, and laid
bare to the world their frailties and their virtues.
He had never betrayed himself, for he never acted
on impulse.  The others were well known to be
made of flesh and blood, of idealism, and dust,
but who knew the real Robespierre?  The very
mystery and doubt in which his true character was
wrapped had lent credence to the common rumour
which attributed to him supernatural qualities.  He
was compared to the pure source, high among virgin
snows, from which the Revolution sprung.
</p>

<p>
He stood alone on his pedestal, inaccessible,
unassailable.  All the great leaders of the Revolution,
his predecessors or his rivals, had disappeared,
carried off in the whirlwind, victims of their
exaggerated enthusiasm, as Mirabeau and Marat, or of
Robespierre's treachery, as Danton and Camille
Desmoulins, ground in the sanguinary mill of the
Revolutionary Tribunal, on his sole accusation.
</p>

<p>
Thus when his path was cleared of those who
stood most in his way, he anticipated the time when
he should hold the destiny of France in his hand,
aided by the Convention now subdued to his will,
and the whole armed force grovelling at his feet.
</p>

<p>
Yet one obstacle remained to be surmounted: the
Committee of Public Safety to whom the Convention
had transferred its authority, and of which he
was a member, but where he felt a terrible
undercurrent of animosity directed against him.
</p>

<p>
At this point Robespierre realised that he must
either cajole or conquer them.  For if they were
curbed and reduced to silence, he would have all
power absolutely in his own hands.  The hour was
approaching.  It was necessary to strike a decisive
blow, and he thought to have found the means to
do so, and to overawe the Committee, at his Festival
of the Supreme Being, which would take place in a
couple of days, when he would speak to the assembled
multitude, and dominate his colleagues in his
quality of President of the Convention, a post he
had sought in order to have an opportunity to assert
himself at this lay ceremony, this parody of the
religious celebrations of the old regime.
</p>

<p>
His intention was to confirm in public, amid the
acclamations of the populace, the religion of a new
God, whose existence he had just proclaimed&mdash;the
God of Nature, a stranger to Christianity, borrowed
entire from Rousseau's famous pages in <i>le Vicaire
Savoyard</i>.  Robespierre's sectarian temperament
experienced a deeper satisfaction than he had perhaps
ever felt, at the thought that he was to declaim,
among flowers and incense, those empty, sonorous
phrases which he was writing on the little walnut
table where his master had found some of his most
burning inspirations.  He became in his own eyes
the high priest of the Republic, offering incense on
the altar of his own superhuman sovereignty.  Yes,
Robespierre could already hear the enthusiastic
applause of the multitude!  Who would dare to stand
in his way after such public consecration in the
immense Place de la Révolution, where for a week
past the platform was being prepared.
</p>

<p>
Such was the man shadowed by Destiny, the further
course of whose chequered career, with its
startling incidents, we are now to follow.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Robespierre had just finished his first discourse,
for he was to deliver two.  He closed it with a
menace.  "People," it ran, "let us under the
auspices of the Supreme Being give ourselves up to a
pure joy.  To-morrow we shall again take arms
against vice and tyrants!"
</p>

<p>
This was his note of warning to those who, he
felt, ranged themselves against him.  Completely
satisfied with himself, he read and re-read his
sentences, stopping to polish periods and phrases, or
seeking graceful and sonorous epithets.  One passage
especially pleased him, for a breath of <i>le Vicaire
Savoyard</i> seemed to pervade it.  He spoke of the
presence of the Supreme Being, in all the joys of
life.  "It is He," he said, "who adds a charm to
the brow of beauty by adorning it with modesty; it
is He who fills the maternal heart with tenderness
and joy; it is He who floods with happy tears the
eyes of a son clasped in his mother's arms."  Robespierre
smiled at the music of the phrasing which in
his pedantry he thought his master would not have
disowned.
</p>

<p>
But he stopped.  After all, was it not a reminiscence
of <i>le Vicaire Savoyard</i>?  Perhaps he had made
use of the same metaphor as Rousseau?  He would
be accused of feeble imitation!  This could be easily
ascertained, as the book was near at hand, in the
little bookcase that once belonged to the master.
He had but to take it from the case.  The key was
in the lock, but it resisted, though he used all his
strength.  Growing impatient, he was about to
break open the door, but paused as though this
would be sacrilege, and at last sent for the gardener.
</p>

<p>
"This lock does not act, does it?" he said.
</p>

<p>
The gardener tried it in his turn, but with no
better success.
</p>

<p>
"It is of the utmost importance for me to have
a book which is in there," said Robespierre, visibly
annoyed.
</p>

<p>
"That can be easily managed, citizen; there is
a locksmith a few steps from here, on the road to
the forest.  I will go and fetch his apprentice."
</p>

<p>
The gardener ran downstairs, and Robespierre
returned to his work.  He was soon aware of
footsteps advancing.  It was the gardener returning
with the apprentice.
</p>

<p>
"This way, citizen," said the gardener.
</p>

<p>
The two men entered.  Robespierre had his
back to them, and continued to write, a happy
inspiration having occurred to him, which he was
shaping into a sentence.  After they had tried
several keys the door yielded at last.
</p>

<p>
"Now it's right, citizen!" said the gardener.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!" said Robespierre, still bending over
his work, and absorbed in his sentence.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the sound of a voice floated up through
the casement:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Petits oiseaux de ce viant bocage...."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was the young apprentice returning home across
the garden, singing.  Robespierre stopped in his
writing, vaguely surprised.  He had heard that air
before!  But where?  When?  This he could not
tell.  It was the echo of a distant memory.  He
turned his head slowly in the direction of the
cadence, but the song had ceased.
</p>

<p>
The fleeting impression was soon effaced, and
Robespierre, having already forgotten the coincidence,
rose and went towards the now open bookcase.
Taking Rousseau's volume, he opened it at
these words: "Is there in the world a more feeble
and miserable being, a creature more at the mercy
of all around it, and in such need of pity, care, and
protection, as a child?"  He passed over two
chapters, turning the pages hastily.  The phrase he
wanted was undoubtedly more towards the end.
As one of the leaves resisted the quick action of his
hand, he stopped a moment to glance at the text:
"From my youth upwards, I have respected marriage
as the first and holiest institution of nature..."  Now
he would find it.  The phrase he wanted
could not be much further!  It soon cheered his
sight: "I see God in all His works, I feel His
presence in me, I see Him in all my surroundings."
</p>

<p>
Robespierre breathed freely again.  Here was
only an analogy of thought, suggested, hinted at
by Rousseau, and which he, Robespierre, had more
fully developed.  Smiling and reassured he returned
to his place.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
THE ENGLISHMAN
</h3>

<p>
These words of Rousseau read before the open
bookcase, suggestive as they were of voices from
the past still echoing through his memory, had no
meaning for him.  They kindled no spark in the
dead embers of his conscience to reveal the truth.
And yet it was a warning from heaven&mdash;a moment
of grave and vital import in the life of this man,
who, had he not been blinded by an insane ambition,
might have recognised in the passing stranger a
messenger of Fate.
</p>

<p>
For the voice which had distracted him from
his work was the voice of Clarisse, and the young
apprentice who had just left him was his son.
</p>

<p>
The outcast child, now grown to manhood, had
been within touch of his own father, but unseen
by him.  No mysterious affinity had drawn them
together, though the voice had vaguely troubled
him as he returned to his work.
</p>

<p>
The young man on leaving <i>l'Ermitage</i> took the
path that led to the forest.  He was a fine, stoutly
built lad, with a brisk lively manner, strong and
supple, revealing in spite of his workman's garb an
air of good breeding which might have perhaps
betrayed his origin to a keen observer.  His hair was
dark brown, his blue eyes looked out from the
sunburnt and weather-beaten face with an expression
of extreme sweetness, and his full lips smiled under
a downy moustache.  He walked with rapid strides,
a hazel stick in his hand, towards the forest, which
he soon reached, threading the paths and bypaths
with the assurance of one to whom the deep wood
and its intricate labyrinths was familiar.  He
slackened his pace now and then to wipe the perspiration
from his forehead, keeping to the more shady side
of the way, for the sun, already high in the heavens,
shed its rays in a burning shower through the leaves,
scorching the very grass in its intensity.  At last,
overcome by the heat, he took off his coat and hung
it at the end of the stick across his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Presently he turned into an avenue of oak saplings
through which a green glade was visible, an
oasis where refreshing coolness told of the presence
of running water.  Here he shaded his eyes with
his hands to make out a form outlined against the
distance, and a smile lit up his face as he recognised
the approaching figure.  Hastening his steps he
called out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Thérèse!"
</p>

<p>
A fresh, clear voice answered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Olivier!  Good morning!" as
a young girl came towards him with outstretched
hands.  She was tall and lithe, of a fair, rosy
complexion, and wore a peasant's dress from which the
colour had long since faded.  She advanced rapidly,
now and then replacing with a quick, graceful movement
the rebel locks of fair hair that caressed her
cheeks, all in disorder from the air and exercise.
</p>

<p>
"You bad boy!  Auntie and I have been quite
anxious about you; but where do you come from?"
</p>

<p>
For only answer the young man kissed her upturned
forehead, and allowed her to take the stick
at the end of which his coat still hung.
</p>

<p>
"And where is mamma?" he asked, continuing
to walk on.
</p>

<p>
"Why, here, of course!" called another voice,
a woman's also, gay and joyous as the other, but
more mellow in tone, and Clarisse's head appeared
above the tall grass.
</p>

<p>
Instantly the young man was in his mother's
arms, and seated by her side on the trunk of a
fallen chestnut lying parallel with the stream, which
in his haste he had cleared at a bound, discarding
the assistance of the little bridge of trees of which
the young girl was more prudently taking advantage.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! my poor Olivier!  What anxiety you
have caused us!  Why are you so late?  And
after being out all night, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you not know that I should not be back?"
the young man asked, looking at his mother.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but we expected you earlier this morning."
</p>

<p>
"It does certainly seem as if it had happened on
purpose," he said, as he explained to them why he
was so late, and he went on to tell them how he
had been kept at the last moment by his employer
for some pressing work at Saint-Prix, a little village
then in full gala, and distant about a league from
the forest.  The Democratic Society of the district
had joined for this occasion with the Montmorency
Society, and there were of course masts to put up, a
stand to erect, or rather to improvise, for everything
was behindhand.  Olivier had been told off to fix
iron supports to the steps raised for the convenience
of the populace.  They had worked, he said, till
late in the night by candle light, and in the
morning, when he was preparing to come home, he had to
go to <i>l'Ermitage</i> to open a bookcase, just to oblige
the gardener who was such a good fellow, though
the tenant...
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" interrupted Clarisse, always fearful
and uneasy at the thought of her son going to a
stranger's house.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know at all," replied Olivier.  "I only
know that he didn't even disturb himself to thank
me.  They have pretty manners, these Republicans;
the old aristocracy were at least polite."
</p>

<p>
But his mother stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hush!  Do not speak like that; suppose
you were heard!"
</p>

<p>
And, putting her arms round his neck, as if to
shield him from some possible danger, she asked him
what news he brought from the workshop.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing but the same string of horrors at Paris,
and it was even said that the number of victims had
sensibly increased."
</p>

<p>
Carried away by his subject, he detailed to the
two women scraps of conversation overheard that
night at the village of Saint-Prix.  As he spoke,
Marie Thérèse, now seated near him on the grass,
with his coat spread before her, silently smoothed
out the creases, and his mother drank in every
word with breathless attention.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was left of the Clarisse of sixteen but
the velvet softness of the blue eyes, and the sweet
charm of their expression, with all the pristine
freshness of a pure soul still mirrored in their
depth.  The thin, colourless face seemed modelled
in deep furrows, and the fair hair was already shot
with silver.  Though poorly clad in the dress of a
peasant, she also might have betrayed her better
birth to a practised observer by her white hands,
with tapered fingers and delicate wrists, and by the
supple grace of her bearing.  But who could regard
as an aristocrat this poor woman, almost old,
sheltering under her maternal wing the stout young
workman, with his resolute air and hands blackened at
the forge?
</p>

<p>
She now went under the name of Durand, as did
her son and her niece, Marie Thérèse, who passed
as the child of her brother-in-law.  The young girl
was, in reality, the daughter of her own brother, the
young student of the College of Navarre, who had
been killed the preceding year in Vendée, fighting in
the ranks of the Chouans, in the Royalist cause.
Clarisse's husband also met his fate at one of these
sanguinary combats, for he was so dangerously
wounded that a few days after he had been secretly
conveyed to London he died in great agony.
</p>

<p>
For Clarisse had been married, and was now a widow.
</p>

<p>
And her past: it could be written in a page&mdash;a
little page; yet in writing it her hand would have
trembled at every line.  Deserted by her betrayer,
receiving no reply to her letters, she realised, when
too late, his cold egoism and ambition.  She had
been separated from her child, who was born in the
retirement of a little village of Dauphiné, whither
her father had taken her, and had been immediately
confided to the care of peasants, where she was
allowed to visit him once a fortnight, subject to
a thousand precautions imposed by Monsieur de
Pontivy.
</p>

<p>
And yet, with all this weight of sadness,
Clarisse retained her native grace.  Misfortune
had but added charm to her delicate and
melancholy beauty.
</p>

<p>
It sometimes happened, though very seldom, that
she was obliged to accompany her father into society.
On one of these rare occasions she attracted the
notice of a young captain of the Queen's Guards,
Monsieur de Mauluçon, who sought her society
assiduously, fell in love with her, and asked
Monsieur de Pontivy for her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Your offer does us much honour," the Councillor
had replied, "but I should wish you to see
Mademoiselle de Pontivy herself, before renewing
your request to me."
</p>

<p>
And Monsieur de Pontivy notified the fact to
Clarisse the same evening with characteristic
formality:
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur de Mauluçon," he said, "whose
affection, it appears, you have won, has done me
the honour of asking for your hand.  I gave him
to understand that you alone would dispose of it.
He will be here to-morrow afternoon to confer
with you.  I do not know if he pleases you, but
this I know, that if you wish to accept his offer
you must lay before him the story of your past.
And I need not tell you that if, after this, he
persists in making you his wife, you can rely on
my consent."
</p>

<p>
"It shall be as you wish, father," Clarisse
answered.
</p>

<p>
That open nature, which was her most touching
trait, made her father's attitude seem quite natural.
She did not wait to think that Monsieur de Pontivy
could have spared her the shame of this avowal by
making it himself, for the fault of another is more
easily confessed than our own.  Clarisse only felt
that, having inflicted a wrong on her father, she was
in duty bound to expiate it.  And, in truth, it did
not cost her so much to make the confession to
Monsieur de Mauluçon as it would to have broken
it to any other, for he had from the first inspired
her with unbounded confidence.  She had read a
manly generosity in the kindly expression of his
frank, open face.  She would never have dreamt of
becoming his wife, but since he had offered himself
why not accept the proffered support of so strong
an arm?  She well knew in her lonely existence
that her father would never be the loving friend and
protector that, in the utter weakness of her betrayed
and blighted womanhood, she had yearned for
through so many long days!
</p>

<p>
But her child, her little Olivier, would he be an
obstacle?  At the thought her eyes filled with tears.
What did it matter?  She would only love him the
more, the angel, and suffering would but bind them
closer together!  However, it was now to be decided,
and both their destinies would be sealed, for
she well knew that if Monsieur de Mauluçon drew
back after her confession, all prospects of marriage
would be over, for never again could she so
humiliate herself, though she could bring herself to it
now, for she had read a deep and tender sympathy
in her lover's eyes.  And, after all, what mattered
it if she were not his wife?  She would at least
remain worthy of his pity, for he could not despise
her.  Her confession would create a tie between
them which he would perhaps remember later on,
when her little Olivier engaged in the battle of
life.
</p>

<p>
When Monsieur de Mauluçon came again to her,
innocent of all suspicion, he found her grave and
deeply moved.  In a few brief words she laid bare
to him the history of her past, and he was too
high-souled, too strong and generous, to feel anything but
an immense pity for a heart of exquisite sensibility,
wrecked by its own confiding impulses, misunderstood,
misled, and then forsaken.
</p>

<p>
He took both her hands in his and pressed them
to his lips respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"And the child," he said; "whose name does
he bear?"
</p>

<p>
"Luc-Olivier.  Olivier is my father's Christian
name."
</p>

<p>
"But he must have a name!  We will give him
ours.  Mauluçon is as good as Pontivy."
</p>

<p>
"How can that be?" Clarisse answered, thinking
she must be dreaming.  "Do you mean you
will adopt my child? ... Oh!  Monsieur! ... Monsieur!..."
and she stammered incoherent
words of gratitude, struggling with an emotion which
seemed to strangle her.
</p>

<p>
"I also have a Christian name"&mdash;and he bent
low, whispering softly in her ear&mdash;"my name is
Maurice."
</p>

<p>
She turned towards him with a wan smile, and as
he stooped to kiss his affianced bride she melted into
tears.
</p>

<p>
The child was just two years old.  The young
couple took him with them in their travels.  They
then established themselves at Pontivy, near the
grandfather, who had softened towards his daughter
since her marriage, partly won by the baby charm
of his grandchild.  Their visits to Paris became less
frequent, for Monsieur de Mauluçon, in order better
to enjoy his home life, obtained an unlimited leave
of absence.  He now devoted himself to Olivier's
education, who was growing up a bright, frank, and
affectionate boy.  Except Monsieur de Pontivy and
Clarisse's brother Jacques, no one but themselves
knew the story of his birth.  Jacques de Pontivy,
recently married, had kept it even from his wife,
who died, however, some months after giving birth
to a baby girl, whom Clarisse now loved as much as
her own Olivier.
</p>

<p>
Life seemed to smile at last upon the poor woman,
when the Revolution broke out.  Jacques de
Pontivy, who had intended to succeed his father in
Parliament, seeing the Royal Family menaced,
entered the army, which Monsieur de Mauluçon had
also rejoined.  Both endeavoured several times to
give open proof of their loyal sentiments.  They
covered the flight of Louis XVI. and Marie
Antoinette, and were nearly taken at the arrest of the
King and Queen on their way to Varennes, and the
next year they were obliged to fly from France, and
both sought refuge in England, resolved to serve
the Royalist cause with all their energy and devotion
to the last.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, who had remained at Paris with her
husband during those stormy times, now rejoined her
father at the Château de Pontivy, with Olivier and
little Marie Thérèse.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur de Pontivy, whose health was fast failing,
was struck to the heart by the rapid march of
events and the sudden collapse of all his most
cherished surroundings.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing left but to die," he would say
sometimes, looking on with indifference at the vain
attempts of his son and son-in-law, whose firm faith
and enthusiasm he no longer understood, tired and
disgusted as he was with everything.
</p>

<p>
Another tie which bound Clarisse to France was
the charge of the two children.  Almost grown up
now, they were still too young to be exposed to the
danger of travelling in such uncertain times, when
the frontiers were scarcely guarded, and France was
committed to a course which had estranged her from
the nations of Europe.
</p>

<p>
But when Clarisse heard that Monsieur de Mauluçon
and her brother were on the eve of leaving
London for Southampton to rejoin the royal army
in Vendée, she hesitated no longer.
</p>

<p>
Confiding the children to their grandfather's care,
she left Pontivy, and arrived in London, to find her
husband and brother at the house of a mutual friend,
Benjamin Vaughan, whose acquaintance they had
made at the American Embassy in Paris, at a
reception on the anniversary of the United States
Independence, and with whom they had become intimate.
</p>

<p>
But Clarisse had hardly rejoined her husband,
when a letter reached her from Pontivy telling her
that if she wished to hear her father's last words she
must come at once.  She returned to France almost
beside herself with grief, giving her whole soul to
her husband in a parting kiss.
</p>

<p>
It was to be their last.
</p>

<p>
Misfortune followed misfortune with astounding
rapidity.  Monsieur de Mauluçon and Jacques de
Pontivy soon landed at Saint-Paire, and joined the
Vendean army.  At the first encounter Jacques was
killed by a Republican bullet, and Monsieur de
Mauluçon mortally wounded.  He was secretly
conveyed to London with other wounded royalists,
and in spite of the fraternal welcome and care he
found under the roof of the faithful friend who had
always received them with open arms, he died there
of his wounds.  Clarisse learnt her double bereavement
at the time when her father was breathing his
last.
</p>

<p>
Thus she became a widow and an orphan in that
brief space of time.
</p>

<p>
Prostrated by this double blow, she was for some
time at death's door.  When she came to herself
after a delirium which lasted nearly a week, she saw
her children&mdash;for Marie Thérèse, now doubly
orphaned, was more her child than ever&mdash;seated at
her bedside awaiting in unspeakable anxiety her
return to consciousness.  She drew them to her, and
covered them with kisses.
</p>

<p>
"Console yourselves," she said, "I shall live,
since you are here."
</p>

<p>
At this moment a man advanced smilingly towards
her, his eyes glistening with tears of joy.
</p>

<p>
"Leonard!" she said, "you here?"
</p>

<p>
It was an old servant of Monsieur de Pontivy,
who had come in all haste from Montmorency,
where he lived, to attend the funeral of his late
master.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" he cried, "Madame can rest assured
Leonard will not leave her till she is herself again."
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall remain ill as long as possible,"
she replied laughing, and she held out her hands to
him.
</p>

<p>
Her convalescence was short, and as soon as she
was on her feet again she began to think of the
future.  But Leonard had already thought of this.
"You cannot remain here," he said.  "Your name,
your connections, your fortune&mdash;everything
denounces you, and exposes you to the ill-treatment
of so-called patriots.  You must leave Pontivy."
</p>

<p>
"Go?  But where?" asked Clarisse, "Abroad?
I have already thought of that, but how can I reach
the frontier with my young people without passport,
and without guide?"
</p>

<p>
"The surest way to find shelter and safety is to
remain in France," Leonard answered.  "Listen to
my plans.  I have a cottage hidden among the trees
in a little hollow of the forest of Montmorency.
The place is lonely and little frequented.  You can
take it in a borrowed name as my tenant.  An
honest couple, well known to me, a gardener and
his wife, will assist in the house, and in the cultivation
of the little plot of ground.  To avert suspicion,
you can place your son with me as apprentice.  I
am one of the most influential members of the
Democratic Society of Montmorency.  My patronage
is therefore a guarantee of your Republican
principles.  Olivier will learn a trade, and remain
under your care, for he can return home every night
to dinner, and thus, dear lady, we will await better
times."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse consented joyfully, and in eight days the
little family were installed in the cottage of the
forest, secure and safe, in a narrow valley thickly
planted with trees, whose bushy branches formed a
second roof over their humble dwelling.  Fourteen
months Clarisse lived there unnoticed, hearing only
of the events happening at Paris from the harrowing
accounts of the guillotine and <i>noyades</i> which her son
brought from the workshop, peopling the sleep of
the two women with fearful dreams.
</p>

<p>
When! oh, when! would they emerge from that
obscurity?  When would the trumpet-call of
deliverance sound for France!  Clarisse dared not
think.  She trembled every instant for her own and
her children's safety; for Olivier above all, who
already took a too lively interest in the conversations
of the workshop, and in popular manifestations.
Clarisse did not acknowledge it that morning when
she met her son, but she had not slept all night,
although she had been aware that he would not
return.  So when the household duties were over she
had come long before the time fixed, to wait for
him, as she often did, in that green glade which
opened on to the path he was wont to take.  When
she saw him in the distance she used to beckon to
him, anticipating the joy of reunion; all a mother's
tenderness smiling in her eyes and on her lips.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse now hoped that, having been out all
night, Olivier would not assist at the <i>fête</i>.  But she
was mistaken, for he took his coat from Marie
Thérèse and prepared to go.  "What! you are
not going to spend the day with us?"
</p>

<p>
"Now!" replied Olivier coaxingly.  "You don't
really mean it.  And what about the <i>fête</i>?  You
know well my absence would be noticed.  All the
youth of Montmorency will be there.  But I promise
you to return for supper.  At all events, I
have an hour before me.  Let us have a crust and
some wine."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse rose from her seat, and Marie Thérèse
helped the lad on with his coat; then all three went
in the direction of the little bridge, but Olivier
retraced his steps directly.  He had forgotten his
stick.  Stooping to pick it up, he heard some one
near him softly asking the way, and looking up, he
found himself in the presence of a stranger, who
pointed to a signpost knocked down by the wind,
and from which the writing was defaced.
</p>

<p>
"Which of these cross-roads leads to La Chèvre?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"This one," Olivier answered.
</p>

<p>
The stranger thanked him, but at the sound of
his voice, Clarisse, who had been listening, turned,
and as she came nearer she gave a cry of joy.
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible!  You here, Vaughan!" and she
came towards him with outstretched hands.
</p>

<p>
The man's face lighted up with joy as he turned
to greet her:
</p>

<p>
"Madame de Mauluçon!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" she said, then lowering her voice, she
introduced the two young people, who, surprised at
first, smiled and shook hands with this friend of
their family, whose name they had so often heard
at Pontivy and Paris.  In a few words Clarisse
explained to the newcomer their circumstances, pointing
out the peasant's cottage hidden among the trees,
where they lived away from the outside world.  As
she spoke her voice trembled, and she could with
difficulty restrain her tears, for the man before her
had held her dying husband in his arms.  It was he
who had heard his last words, closed his eyes, and
sent Clarisse the terrible news.  She longed to
question him, but was restrained by the presence
of the children.  So when Marie Thérèse, who with
a woman's instinct felt they had sad and serious
things to say to each other, asked if they might
leave them, Clarisse thanked her with an eloquent
look.
</p>

<p>
"That is right, children," she said, "go on; we
will rejoin you presently."
</p>

<p>
Alone with Vaughan, her eyes filled with tears;
she overwhelmed him with questions, which he
answered with exquisite delicacy, softening every
painful detail.  Clothing his words considerately in a
mist of generalities, he guided the conversation with
infinite tact, avoiding some points, putting others in
his turn, and finally he spoke of the agreeable
impression that Olivier and Marie Thérèse had
produced on him.
</p>

<p>
"What a pretty couple they would make!" he
said; "but I suppose you have already destined
them for each other!"
</p>

<p>
Now she could smile.  He continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I saw that at once.  I congratulate you.
And when is the wedding-day?"
</p>

<p>
Alas, how could she know?  Under this abominable
Government, marriage in the church had been
abolished, and were they even to satisfy themselves
with a civil contract the mayor would demand their
birth certificates.  These were no longer in her
possession, even had she wished to produce them.
And where were they?
</p>

<p>
"I have them," replied Vaughan.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
He then explained to her how he had found
them among a bundle of papers which her husband
had been sorting, in order to burn the most
compromising, when death overtook him.  He&mdash;Vaughan,
the confidant of his last moments&mdash;had completed
this task.  Among the letters, acts, and accounts,
relating chiefly to politics and the different
movements of the Chouans and the emigrants, he had
found several family documents, some insignificant,
others of more importance.  These he had laid
aside for Clarisse's perusal.
</p>

<p>
"I will now make a confession," he continued,
"which must be made sooner or later."
</p>

<p>
He stopped embarrassed, and then, as if suddenly
resolved, added&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The work of classification has put me in possession
of a family secret.  Among the papers which
I have to return to you are the birth and baptismal
certificates of Olivier."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse looked at him anxiously.  He continued
after a pause&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"In glancing over these I perceived that both were
dated 1775, that is, two years before your marriage."
</p>

<p>
Again he paused as if fearing to have said too much.
</p>

<p>
"And what conclusion did you draw from this?"
she asked, resolved to hear the worst.
</p>

<p>
"That by your marriage with Monsieur de Mauluçon
Olivier was then made legitimate."
</p>

<p>
She recoiled, pale and terrified.  Never had such
a possibility crossed her mind: her husband, the
soul of loyalty and honour, he to be suspected!
</p>

<p>
"You are mistaken," she said, and added, now
quite calm and self-possessed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Olivier bears the name of Monsieur de
Mauluçon, but he is not his son ... he is mine."
</p>

<p>
Vaughan made a gesture as if to prevent her
continuing.  He knew too much now.  Deeply affected
and embarrassed, he murmured a confused apology,
overcome with admiration before this woman, who
so frankly confessed her shame rather than let
suspicion rest for a moment on a husband whose memory
she revered.  She led her companion to the trunk on
which she had been sitting with her son, and asking
him to listen to her story, she told of her youthful
folly, her isolated life, her fall, and the cowardly
desertion of the young secretary, whose name, however,
she concealed; then of the noble generosity of
Monsieur de Mauluçon, who had effaced the past by
adopting as his own her son.
</p>

<p>
"Olivier knows nothing, of course?" asked Vaughan.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely nothing.  He thinks he is Monsieur
de Mauluçon's son."
</p>

<p>
Vaughan took both her hands in his.
</p>

<p>
"You have suffered much," he said.  "May the
rest of your years be years of joy and happiness!"
</p>

<p>
"God grant it!" she answered.  "But it is
hardly to be hoped in such fearful times of trouble
and uncertainty."
</p>

<p>
He did not reply at once, but seemed preoccupied.
Then he said suddenly, as if continuing his thoughts
aloud&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you come with me to England?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you returning, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, in a few days."
</p>

<p>
She gave a little cry of joy, then added regretfully&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is useless to think of it.  There is always that
question of passport in the way."
</p>

<p>
Vaughan reassured her.
</p>

<p>
"I can arrange all that for you," he said.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him in astonishment, wondering how
such a thing could be possible to him, a foreigner.
Then suddenly struck by the recollection that she
had selfishly kept him occupied with her affairs all
the time, she hastened to ask him what had brought
him to France.  Perhaps she was detaining him?
And she begged him to forgive her want of thought.
</p>

<p>
"You need not make any excuse," he said, smiling;
"it would not have interested you, for my presence
here is due to politics.  It must astonish you
that I should come to France when our countries
are at war; but, be assured, I am well protected."
</p>

<p>
And Vaughan explained to her how he had been
sent by an influential member of the House of
Commons to confer with the man who was looked upon
as the most powerful, the master, in fact, of the
Republic&mdash;Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
At the mention of this name Clarisse drew back
terrified.
</p>

<p>
Vaughan evinced no particular surprise, for that
name produced the same effect on every woman.
Was not Robespierre, indeed, the personification of
that bloodthirsty Government in whose iron grip
France was then writhing in agony?
</p>

<p>
He traced a striking portrait of the Incorruptible,
from the intricacies of his subtle politics to the fierce
and stubborn ambition capable of anything to attain
its end.  Clarisse listened, spell-bound and trembling.
</p>

<p>
Vaughan, judging the man from a political standpoint,
estimated him at his true value.  His character,
mediocre at the best, was exaggerated in England.
The Whig party had commissioned Vaughan to
propose to Robespierre an arrangement which, if
accepted, would most likely change the face of things.
But would he accept?  Vaughan doubted it, for the
arrangement, though in one way flattering to the
self-love and pride of the Incorruptible, would at the
same time diminish his importance, and set a curb
on his ambition, which, as Vaughan well knew, with
all the pretensions of the man to simplicity and
republican austerity, was all-absorbing and unbounded.
</p>

<p>
Seeing Clarisse so attentive, Vaughan continued
to paint Robespierre at home in the patriarchal circle
of the Duplay family in the Rue Saint Honoré, where
he occupied a modest apartment between that of the
old couple and their younger son, as whose tutor he
was acting until the time came for his marriage with
Cornelia, Duplay's youngest daughter, to whom, as
it seemed, he was devotedly attached.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, her eyes fixed on Vaughan, drank in
every word.  The Englishman went on, giving a
precise and detailed account of Duplay's home&mdash;a
home guarded by the wife, who watched the door
in real bull-dog fashion, for it was the centre of
mistrust and suspicion.  Yes, Robespierre was well
guarded.  He, Vaughan, even with an introduction
as Pitt's agent, had not been able to see him.  He
had only succeeded after many difficulties in obtaining
an interview in the forest, where he was to confer
with him in secret, until joined by the Duplay
family.  Constantly beset by the fear of the
Committee of Public Safety, who watched his every
movement, he had arranged for a picnic in the
glades, to avert suspicion from this forest interview.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, pale and trembling, made a great effort
to steady her voice, and asked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Is he coming here?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes!" replied Vaughan; "he will be
here directly.  I am a little early."
</p>

<p>
Although accustomed to the effect which the
name of Robespierre always produced, Vaughan
would have been surprised to see Clarisse's emotion
had he watched her face, but being preoccupied,
he looked at her without taking notice, and
continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the chance is opportune.  It will enable
me to ask for your passport.  He cannot refuse."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse looked at him, petrified with horror.
</p>

<p>
"And is it to him that you will go for our
passports?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Vaughan; "and I am quite sure
of obtaining them."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" exclaimed Clarisse.  "It cannot be!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, dear friend?" asked Vaughan, beginning
to show signs of astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"He would want to know my name."
</p>

<p>
"Well! and I should tell him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no; anything but that!" she gasped, bounding
forward as if to seal his lips with her hands; then
she commenced to walk madly to and fro, no longer
able to control her emotion.
</p>

<p>
Vaughan, more and more mystified, looked at
her in amazement.  "I cannot understand you,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
She gazed at him for a moment, silent and hesitating,
then, as if suddenly resolved, she went up to
him.
</p>

<p>
"A word will explain everything.  Since you are
already possessed of half the secret of my life, it is
perhaps better that you should know all."
</p>

<p>
She paused, and then continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Olivier's father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well!" interposed Vaughan, now aghast in his
turn, scarcely daring to understand her.
</p>

<p>
"<i>He</i> is Olivier's father!"
</p>

<p>
And as if broken with the effort, she sank down
by the fallen tree-trunk, and sobbed aloud.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my poor, poor friend!" exclaimed Vaughan
as he bent over her.  "I who thought your sufferings
were at an end, and in my ignorance added to
them by telling you so brutally what I thought of
that man!"
</p>

<p>
"You did not tell me more than I have thought
myself," she said.  "For a long time, to my
contempt for him has been added an absolute
abhorrence."
</p>

<p>
Vaughan here interrupted her with a gesture,
intimating silence, his eyes fixed on the distance.
</p>

<p>
"Is it he?" she said in a trembling whisper.
</p>

<p>
Vaughan continued to look.  He could make out
the dim outline of a man's form advancing through
the trees.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse turned to escape, whispering as she
went: "Will you come on afterwards to the house?"
</p>

<p>
"No; to-morrow I will, not to-day.  He is sure
to have me followed," replied Vaughan, his eyes still
fixed on the advancing figure.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse was about to reply, but Vaughan had
recognised Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"It is he!" he exclaimed.  "Go quickly, he is
coming this way," pointing to the path by which
Olivier had come.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse had already crossed the stream and was
standing behind a curtain of reeds.  She parted
them gently and asked, with shaking voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
Even in her fear she remained a woman, divided
between a horror of the man and the desire to see
him again.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I see him...  Adieu, till to-morrow...."
</p>

<p>
The reeds fell back into their places, and
Vaughan, left alone, seated himself on the
tree-trunk.  Robespierre soon came up, walking
leisurely, a bunch of blue periwinkles in his hand,
his eyes on the grass, seeking others.  He stooped
here and there to gather and arrange them daintily
as a bouquet.  He was elegantly dressed, with
top-boots, chamois knee-breeches, a tight-fitting
redingote of grey stuff, and a waistcoat with revers.  A
red-haired dog of Danish breed gambolled before
him, without fraternising unduly, as if his master's
faultless attire somewhat overawed him.  At a
few steps from the stream Robespierre perceived
Vaughan, and came to an abrupt halt.  At the
same time two men appeared, wearing carmagnole
jackets and two-horned hats, and carrying stout
cudgels.  Vaughan rose to meet the Incorruptible.
The dog began to bark.
</p>

<p>
"Advance no further!" cried Robespierre.
"Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
He made a sign to the two men, who evidently
had been acting as scouts, and sent them towards
Vaughan, who, though aware of his ways, was
still a little taken back at these strange
preliminaries.  Vaughan gave the two men his note of
introduction.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre took the paper, and drew out of his
pocket a gold case, from which he took a pair of
blue, silver-rimmed spectacles, which he carefully
wiped and put on.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," he said, after reading the note;
and addressing himself to the two men, he added,
"Leave me now, but do not go far, and, above all,
keep watch round about."
</p>

<p>
And Robespierre crossed the bridge, and advanced
towards Vaughan, followed by his dog.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
THE ARREST
</h3>

<p>
The two men measured each other from head to
foot with rapid glances; the one with curiosity, the
other with mistrust; and, as if the letter of
introduction had not sufficed, Robespierre requested the
Englishman to give his name.  Vaughan complied,
thinking it unadvisible to bandy words with such a
personage.  He it was, he explained, who on his
arrival from London had written to Robespierre the
day before, asking the favour of an interview.  He
had been in Paris two days, and was staying at the
American Consulate, under the name of Martin, but
his real name was Vaughan&mdash;Benjamin Vaughan,
one of the Whig members of the Opposition in the
House of Commons.  He then unfolded to Robespierre
the object of his mission, telling him how he
had been sent by the illustrious Fox, the fierce
opponent of Pitt's anti-republican policy...
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," Robespierre interposed.  "I
know Mr. Fox is the champion of democracy.  He
is a grand character, and richly gifted.  I had his
speeches translated, and read them with intense
interest.  I followed every word of his fine
oratorical contest with Burke, and was deeply moved at
the solemn rupture of their friendship of twenty
years' standing!  Ah!  There is something grand,
heroic, thus to sunder the closest tie in defence of
one's principles.  It is worthy of another age.
They are Romans, your leaders!  And what are
Mr. Fox's wishes, may I ask?"
</p>

<p>
The Englishman was about to explain the principal
points, when Robespierre again interrupted him
by a gesture.  Did he not hear a noise among the
leaves, though Blount, the watch-dog, who prowled
round about like a vigilant sentinel, had not barked?
Robespierre begged Vaughan to continue, but was
still on the <i>qui-vive</i>, listening with divided attention,
nervous and uneasy, as if fearing to be surprised in
this conference with a stranger.
</p>

<p>
And the interview was, to say the least,
compromising.  Fox and his influential friends of the
Whig party proposed a secret agreement which
would perhaps induce England and the Powers
allied against France to put down their arms, thus
giving satisfaction to the Royalists, without in any
way interfering with the legitimate claims of the
Revolutionists.  Robespierre looked at the Englishman
in surprise, still unable to grasp his meaning.
</p>

<p>
Vaughan then explained more concisely that the
Whig party dreamt of establishing a Constitutional
monarchy in France, on the same principles as in
England, with the little son of Louis XVI., now
a prisoner in the Temple, as King ...
</p>

<p>
"But think a moment!" interrupted Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"With a Regency, of course, and an absolute
guardianship," continued Vaughan.
</p>

<p>
"The French nation would never hear of it."
</p>

<p>
"But why not, since the Regency would be
confided to you?"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre started back.
</p>

<p>
"What, to me!  I, the Regent, the tutor of that
boy?  You are joking!"
</p>

<p>
The "Incorruptible" did not think fit to tell him
that five years previously he had vainly solicited the
position of tutor to the royal infant at Versailles.
He now walked excitedly to and fro, asserting
positively his refusal, in short, broken phrases; all the
while on the alert for the slightest sound, and
stopping now and then to ask, "Did you hear anything?
I thought I heard steps?  Are you there, Blount?
Hoop la!  Good dog!  Keep a good watch!"
</p>

<p>
Carried away by his vanity, Robespierre laid his
soul bare before the Englishman, who listened with
the greatest curiosity and interest.  "Restore Royalty?
Ah! it was too ludicrous!  Had he worked, then,
to re-establish a kingdom for the son of the man he
had sent to the scaffold?  No! he had worked first
for France, whom he had purged of her internal
evils, of the whole corrupt and infamous crowd that
had so long polluted her!  And then for himself;
oh no! not from motives of personal ambition, but
because he felt himself called to regenerate his
country, to breathe into her a new soul, cleansed in
the pure waters of virtue and justice and equality.
</p>

<p>
"Regent, indeed?  Fox could not mean it!
Dictator, perhaps; Protector, as was Cromwell;
Lord-Protector of his country, now degraded by
centuries of tyranny and corruption.  Ah! they
would soon see her arise, pure and radiant, cleansed
of all stain, regenerated by a baptism of blood!  A
few more heads, and then from the soil soaked with
the blood of aristocrats, those butchers of the old
regime, would spring the tree of liberty, the tree of
life and justice, of joy and love, which would bring
forth marvellous fruits, and to whose branches France
would cling for support and nourishment, as to a
mother's breast!"
</p>

<p>
Vaughan gazed at him in bewilderment.  For
through this ambition, this bloodthirsty hypocrisy,
he descried the madman; and the Englishman said
within himself that the man was absolutely
dangerous.  He only interrupted Robespierre as a
matter of form, knowing well there was absolutely
nothing in the way of common sense to be looked
for in such a fanatic.
</p>

<p>
"So you refuse?" said Vaughan, in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
"Decidedly!"
</p>

<p>
"Then I have only to retire, with your permission."
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre turned round abruptly.  Blount
had started barking, and a man was crossing their
path.
</p>

<p>
"Who is that?" said Robespierre, in a frightened voice.
</p>

<p>
"The man looks like a beggar," said Vaughan,
his eyes bent on the approaching figure.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?" he answered, only half
convinced.  "A spy, perhaps?  For I am
surrounded with spies, monsieur!  Ah, my life is
awful!  And if I were not working for the
happiness of France ..."
</p>

<p>
A sound of voices was on the air, and the bark
of a dog died away in the distance.  It was
Robespierre's two scouts driving off the beggar.
</p>

<p>
Released from suspense, Robespierre turned again
to Vaughan.
</p>

<p>
"We must part company now," he said, "but
not a word of our interview!  I can count on your
discretion, I am sure.  If not, beware, for I could
charge you with attempted bribery and corruption."
</p>

<p>
Vaughan assured him of his secrecy, telling him
he was returning to London by Geneva, to allay
suspicion.  Seeing Robespierre's agitation, he felt it
was hardly the moment to ask for the passports he
required for Clarisse and her two young people.
He ventured, however, but saw immediately by the
expression of distrust on the face of his interlocutor
that he was not mistaken.  Robespierre refused
bluntly, saying that Vaughan should use every
precaution to avert discovery.  The slightest imprudence
was sufficient to betray him.  It would be too
noticeable to travel in numbers in times when every
one was suspected and shadowed.  And what would
it be for four people?  His friend had but to come
to him a few days hence, and he would give her the
passports, only too happy to be of service to a family
in whom Monsieur Vaughan was interested.
</p>

<p>
The latter politely declined this offer, feigning
indifference, and took leave of Robespierre, who kept
him in sight until he disappeared round a bend in
the road.
</p>

<p>
Left alone, Robespierre's suspicions were aroused.
He began to ask himself who was the woman in
whom the Englishman was so much interested.
Vaughan had friends, then, in France, to whom no
doubt he would describe their interview in the
forest, or, at the very least, how he had spent the
morning.  Robespierre turned to call his men, who
were close at hand.
</p>

<p>
"Quickly," he cried.  "Set an agent on the
track of the man who has just left, and keep me
informed of his actions and movements until he
leaves Paris.
</p>

<p>
"You are right, citizen, for the fellow looked
d&mdash;d suspicious," said one of the men, Didier, who
played the part of a <i>Trivtay l'Ermite</i> to the
Incorruptible.
</p>

<p>
"How is that?" interrupted Robespierre, starting.
</p>

<p>
Then Didier, who had just heard it from one of
his agents on watch in the neighbourhood, told
Robespierre of the interview between Clarisse and
Vaughan at the place they were standing.  He also
described the hurried departure of Clarisse when
Robespierre arrived, and how she had then flown, in
all haste, to her house, a few steps off, and shut
herself in.
</p>

<p>
This was too much for Robespierre, whose
misgivings had been already awakened.
</p>

<p>
"What! a third person, a stranger, was cognizant
of my interview with the Englishman?  Let
that woman be arrested instantly," he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"But there are two of them," said Didier,
"mother and daughter."
</p>

<p>
"Then have them both arrested!  Arrest the
three of them, for there is also a son, I believe!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but he is not there at this moment," said
Didier.
</p>

<p>
"Then arrest him when he returns!"
</p>

<p>
Didier gave the order to his companion, and returned
to Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"And where must they be taken?" he asked.
"To what prison?"
</p>

<p>
"Where you like!  Only see that they are
arrested immediately.  Now be quiet ... here
come our friends!"
</p>

<p>
The tinkling of a bell was heard, and the crack
of a whip.  Then gay voices and bursts of laughter
and merriment broke on the ear.  A man made his
appearance, who was lame and walked with the
help of a stick, preceded by Blount, the dog
gambolling round him in welcome.  It was Duplay's
nephew, Simon, the wooden-legged.  While a
volunteer in 1792, he had lost his left leg at the battle
of Valmy, and now, disabled and pensioned off by
the army commission, he acted as secretary to Robespierre.
Simon advanced gaily, like a guide reaching
his journey's end.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Maximilien!  Have you been
here long?"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was about to equivocate and say that
he had only just arrived, but he was spared the
trouble of replying.  Cries of "Good morning,
Maximilien!  Good morning, friend!" sounded
across the hedge, a few steps from him.  The whole
Duplay family appeared in sight, all perched on a
cart drawn by a lean, jaded beast.  Old Duplay, in
his shirt sleeves, his face all red and bathed in
perspiration, led the horse by the bridle over the ruts of
the road, while his son, Maurice, a boy of fifteen,
ran about, his hair floating in the wind, waving the
branch of a tree to beat away the flies.  Behind the
cart, pushing it forward by the wheels, was another
man, neatly dressed.  This was Lebas, Robespierre's
colleague at the Convention and at the Committee
of Public Safety, the husband of one of Duplay's
daughters.  In the cart were all the family: mother
Duplay, seated on a stool, a solidly built woman,
with arms bare to the elbow, holding the reins, and
by her side, seated on a heap of provisions and
crockery, were the three daughters, Elizabeth, the
wife of Lebas; Victoire, the youngest, a fair-haired
girl with beautiful eyes; and Eleonore, or Cornélie,
for the Duplays had unearthed the name of a Roman
matron to give her a character of antique grace
in the sight of Robespierre, who, it was said, was
going to marry her.
</p>

<p>
Dark and strong, with clear, almond-shaped eyes,
her hair neatly plaited, Cornélie was dressed like her
sisters, in light summer clothes, with a simplicity in
which a practised eye could detect a grain of
coquetry.  The three sisters wore bonnets, caught up
and fastened with tricolour ribbons and cockades, thus
giving to the old cart, decorated with branches and
palms gathered on the way, an air of gaiety and life.
</p>

<p>
It was a custom of the Duplays to come thus
on fine days to join their friend, in some shady,
secluded spot for a picnic on the grass, and enjoy
his company for a few quiet hours of intimacy in
the silence and coolness of the wood.
</p>

<p>
The cart now stopped.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre gallantly assisted the women to
alight, amidst timid exclamations and flutters of
fear and laughing protests of: "Oh! dear!  How
high!  I shall never be able to get down!" followed
by ripples of laughter and a whole babel of questions
and chatter.  "Have you slept well, <i>bon ami</i>?
Ah!  How well you look this morning!"
</p>

<p>
"The joy of seeing you," replied Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
They went into ecstasy over his slightest words.
Oh, how good he was, how kind!  And what a
dream the place was, so joyous, so cool!  Only he
could have discovered such a spot!
</p>

<p>
Mother Duplay had already commenced unpacking
the provisions&mdash;slices of sausage, shrimp
paste, cold chicken, a melon, watercress, Brie
cheese, and buns.  She called her daughters to
help her, whilst Duplay unharnessed the horse and
Lebas conversed with Robespierre, giving him the
latest news from Paris.  Wooden-legged Simon
looked around for a convenient spot to spread the
cloth, and the boy Maurice occupied himself in
coaxing Blount to stand on his hind legs and beg
for sugar.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly all movement was suspended, and every
ear strained to listen, for screams were heard
coming from behind the clump of trees in the background.
</p>

<p>
"It sounds like women's voices," said Cornélie
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"You were right, they were women's voices,"
repeated Madame Lebas, who had advanced in the
direction whence the sound came.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre hastened to reassure them.
</p>

<p>
"It is nothing!" he said calmly, and as every
one looked at him questioning, he added indifferently,
"They are only arresting two aristocrats!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is that all?" said the two women, reassured.
</p>

<p>
Duplay and Simon approached nearer the Incorruptible,
scenting a story.  Robespierre assumed an
air of superior mystery.  It was a good find....
He had tracked them down....
</p>

<p>
At this moment Didier appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Is everything right?" asked Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"Everything is right, citizen," replied Didier.
</p>

<p>
Apparently satisfied, the Incorruptible turned
round, and went towards Cornélie, who had stooped
to gather a daisy.  A few steps off, on the other
trunk, Robespierre had laid the bouquet of blue
periwinkles gathered in his morning walk through
the forest.  He now offered it to her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the pretty things!" she exclaimed, thanking
him for the delicate attention.
</p>

<p>
"It was the flower Rousseau loved," Robespierre
observed.
</p>

<p>
"You are as kind and good as he," the young
girl replied, knowing she gave pleasure to the
Incorruptible in thus comparing him to his master.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, pleased and flattered, fastened the
flowers in the young girl's dress.  A gentle breeze
murmured through the leaves, fanning them as it
passed.  It had come from afar, laden with a scent
of cultivated blossoms, the heavy perfume of roses
that grew in Clarisse's garden.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, life is sweet sometimes," sighed Cornélie.
</p>

<p>
And Robespierre, inhaling deep draughts of the
perfumed air, assented with a smile.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE SON
</h3>

<p>
Olivier did not wait until the end of the rejoicings
at Saint-Prix.  About five o'clock, profiting by
a moment when the public were occupied with one
of the usual commonplaces of popular festivals,
and their attention was fixed on the simulated
dispute of two mountebanks on the stage, he made his
way through the gaping groups until he reached the
country.  Besides the pleasure of surprising his
mother and Thérèse by his unexpected return, the
thoughts of an early supper and a long sleep
possessed him pleasantly as he quickened his steps.
</p>

<p>
His nerves had been more unstrung by all this
bustle and movement of the revels than by the
sleepless night he had passed on the eve of the <i>fête</i>.
His brain reeled; he had been dazed in the
midst of the surging tumult, the boisterous merrymaking
of a multitude let loose under the burning
midsummer sun, as the clamour rolled in swelling
waves of sound above the crowd, above the gleam
and shimmer of tricolour scarves and cockades,
up to the official stands, in murmurs of enthusiastic
approval, which harmonised with the extravagant
harangues of the orators almost as a musical
accompaniment.
</p>

<p>
How they mouthed their periods, and declaimed
their sentences, lavish of revolutionary rant,
repeated and reiterated to such excess that Olivier's
heart throbbed and a pulse beat at his temples,
responsive to the din of those recurring words
liberty, equality, fraternity, truth, justice, virtue,
tyrant, pervert, corruptor, and suspect!  And to
think that to-morrow it would all begin again!
For at the workshop they discussed politics, and
he dared not be indifferent, or even appear
luke-warm before these enthusiasts, or he would be
immediately suspected!  Ah, yes!  Every one was
suspected who did not howl with the wolves.
</p>

<p>
"My God!  I am weary to death of it all," he
exclaimed, in a sudden revulsion of feeling at the
<i>rôle</i> he had assumed for fourteen months&mdash;he, the
son of a noble, of a Vendean!  His lips quivered,
his breast heaved at the thought of the string of
horrors discussed and upheld in his presence,
which caused every fibre of his being to shrink,
and against which his whole soul revolted in mute
indignation.
</p>

<p>
The image of two women rose before his eyes:
his mother with joined hands imploring him to
moderate his zeal, to subdue the impetuous ardour
of his youth a while longer.
</p>

<p>
"Have but a little patience," she would say;
"it will not, cannot last.  The reaction is nearer
than you think."
</p>

<p>
He smiled at her over-confidence, feigned
perhaps to quiet him, as he hastened his steps, thinking
of the expected kiss, picturing her joy and surprise,
imagining himself already in her arms, looking into
her eyes, so full of tender love, and saying to her,
"Yes, mother, it is I, and I am going to stay till
to-morrow morning!"
</p>

<p>
Olivier had taken a path across a rough and
woody district, which shortened his walk by the
third of a mile.  He felt worn out, but at the sight of
the trees in the distance which surrounded their little
cottage, he took heart and quickened his steps.
</p>

<p>
The gardener was waiting for him at the door,
and Olivier called out to him joyfully&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, Paul!  You did not expect to see me
so soon, eh?"
</p>

<p>
But the man's expression told him instantly that
something unusual had happened.  His mother was
ill perhaps&mdash;or Thérèse?  He began to question
the man anxiously, and when he reached him,
stammered out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What is amiss?  What is it?  Oh, tell me quickly!"
</p>

<p>
In a few words the gardener told him all: how
the home had been invaded; the arrest of the two
women; the agent's rough, off-hand replies to
Clarisse's entreaties and protestations; then their
tears, their screams, and their hurried departure in
the direction of Montmorency, hastened, no doubt,
to avoid disturbing the little family gathering just
near the Carrefour de la Chèvre.
</p>

<p>
Olivier, overpowered by the terrible details the
gardener had been giving him, did not even think
of asking to what family gathering he was alluding,
but the name of the place, the Carrefour de la
Chèvre struck him at once, and made him think of
Vaughan.
</p>

<p>
"And the Englishman?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Which Englishman?" the gardener replied.
</p>

<p>
Olivier, seizing him nervously by the arm,
hurriedly explained.
</p>

<p>
"You know that when I left this morning,
Thérèse was alone....  My mother....  Did
not she return afterwards with a stranger?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered the gardener, "the citoyenne
Durand returned alone, and even...."
</p>

<p>
"And even, what?"
</p>

<p>
"And even in great haste.  She seemed excited,
looking behind her, as if she did not wish to be
seen by the pleasure-party."
</p>

<p>
"What pleasure-party?" asked Olivier excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"A pleasure-party of citoyens and citoyennes,
who were picnicking on the grass at the cross-roads
of la Chèvre, and who seemed to know all about the
arrest, for one of the agents went to speak to them
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"And who were they?" asked Olivier, thinking
he was on the track at last.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, citoyen, I do not know."
</p>

<p>
"Are they still there?" inquired Olivier, with a
ray of hope.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! they have been gone a long time."
</p>

<p>
"In what direction?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say."
</p>

<p>
"And you say that my mother and Thérèse have
been taken to Montmorency?"
</p>

<p>
"I am quite sure of it, unless, of course, the
agents could find means of conveyance somewhere
else."
</p>

<p>
"A conveyance?  What for?"
</p>

<p>
"To take them to Paris."
</p>

<p>
"Are they going to Paris, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so, as they are arrested."
</p>

<p>
Arrested!  Olivier could not reconcile himself to
the idea.  Why arrested?  What had they done?
Of what crime were they guilty?  For the tenth
time the gardener told him he knew no more than
he did, and the lad, beside himself with rage,
violently reproached the gardener for not having
fetched him at once from Saint-Prix.
</p>

<p>
"And who would have watched the house?"
the gardener replied, who had thought it better to
guard his bedridden wife than to compromise
himself by starting off in search of Olivier.
</p>

<p>
The young man rushed into the house like a
whirlwind, his haggard eyes roving round the empty
rooms, with the mad, impossible hope that Thérèse
was hidden behind some piece of furniture, and
would burst upon him in a peal of laughter, as in
the days of childish gambols.  Then suddenly he
darted off like a madman in the direction of
Montmorency.  He would go and tell the news to
Leonard, who must have returned by this time.
Perhaps he already knew?  He stopped as
suddenly: an idea had struck him.  If the agents had
ordered a conveyance at Montmorency, he had only
to interrogate the driver.  That was clear enough!
So he resumed his headlong course, jumping the
ditches as he went, reckless of all risks.
</p>

<p>
On the way he fell into Leonard's arms.  The
locksmith had learnt everything from the driver
who had taken Clarisse and Thérèse to Paris, and
had stopped at the workshop on his way back.  The
two women had been placed in the prison of La
Bourbe, at Port-Royal, arrested as "suspects."
</p>

<p>
"But by whose orders?" asked Olivier, stupefied.
</p>

<p>
"Robespierre's."
</p>

<p>
"The wretch!" he vociferated as he fell on a
chair, frantic with rage.
</p>

<p>
But he was soon on his feet again, resolute and
decided.
</p>

<p>
"I must go!" he said; "I must start at once
for Paris.  I must have them from that prison!
For now prison means the guillotine!"
</p>

<p>
Leonard held him back, begging him to wait till
the morrow, entreating him to be prudent, and to
do nothing rashly.  But Olivier was deaf to counsel
or entreaty, and at last succeeded in obtaining from
the locksmith the address of a furnished apartment
in the Rue du Rocher, in a quiet, respectable house.
Only giving himself time to go in the adjoining
room and take a travelling-bag he had left in
Leonard's care, packed with a few clothes and
sundry other articles brought with him from Pontivy,
Olivier started for Paris, accompanied at first by
Leonard, who took leave of him at a junction of
the roads.
</p>

<p>
"Pray for me, Leonard," he said, taking an
affectionate farewell, "for I say it again, they shall
come out of that prison, even if I have to pay for it
with my life."
</p>

<p>
At midnight Olivier arrived at the Rue du Rocher,
having walked the whole way without really knowing
how, mind and body being given up to the one
haunting thought.  He rang at the house indicated
to him, and secured a room, mentioning Leonard as
a reference, and when the concierge asked his name
he replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Germain, Citoyen Germain.  Could I go to
my room now?  I am so sleepy."
</p>

<p>
And yet he did not sleep.  He did not even
attempt to lie down, but paced the room impatiently,
trying at times to sit down quietly, then rising to
recommence his walk to and fro, waiting for the
daylight with feverish impatience.  He undid his
bed, rumpled it to make it look as if it had been
slept in, and going downstairs knocked gently at the
concierge's room to have the front door opened.
He then hastened through the deserted streets to the
prison of La Bourbe, without once asking his way,
for the directions Leonard had given him were firmly
engraved on his memory, and arrived there sooner
than he had expected.
</p>

<p>
When the grey and red mass of Port-Royal Abbey
rose before him, his heart beat wildly.  It was in
one of those buildings, now transformed into a
prison, that his mother and his <i>fiancée</i> were immured!
It was within those walls that they suffered, that
they wept bitter tears in their utter despair, thinking
surely of him, wondering what had been his fate!
</p>

<p>
And the reality appeared even more desperate
now!  In his haste to reach them Olivier had not
considered how to gain admittance to the prison.
In a moment all the difficulty of such an undertaking
rushed on his mind, as he stood alone and helpless
before those massive walls.  Trying to solve the
problem, he devised schemes only to discard them as
impracticable.  He no longer scanned the windows,
for fear of attracting attention.  He suspected a
spy in every passer-by.  Once he even tried to
assume a smile, thinking his mental agony might be
seen on his face.  He put on an air of indifference,
making a <i>détour</i> of the prison, carelessly examining
everything to avert suspicion.  At last, thoroughly
worn out, he moved away, vaguely hoping to find a
happy inspiration in some lonely spot, where he could
be more master of himself.
</p>

<p>
To whom could he turn for assistance?  He
knew no one.  All the friends of his family, formerly
settled in Paris, were now either abroad or in
prison, if they had not perished on the scaffold or in
the war.  And then he thought of the Englishman
Vaughan.  Where was he to be found?  In prison,
perhaps, arrested with the others in the forest.
Everything was possible.  A sudden idea flashed
across his mind, an idea which, however, he quickly
rejected, judging it imprudent.  He had wandered
into the Rue des Lions, the neighbourhood of his
grandfather's town house, and had thought of Benoit,
the porter.  Was he still there?  He shrugged his
shoulders despairingly, just remembering that the
mansion was now the property of the State.  The
neighbours might also recognise him, and he would
compromise himself uselessly.
</p>

<p>
Thus wandering, Olivier found himself back again
in the Rue du Rocher, in front of his lodgings,
though he could not tell by what way he had come.
Going up to his room, he locked himself in to rest
a while.  His head swam, and he realised for the
first time that he had eaten nothing since the
previous day, so he called down to ask if he could have
something to eat.  As it was just breakfast-time
they sent up some eggs, a cutlet, and some fruit.
He ate the eggs, tasted the cutlet, but did not finish
it.  Then, as a reaction set in, he sunk into an
armchair and slept.
</p>

<p>
When Olivier awoke it was four o'clock.  He
started up quickly, vexed at having lost his day, and
hurried downstairs.  On the ground floor the
concierge stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"I want a word with you," he said.  "You are
really the citoyen Germain, are you not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Olivier, already apprehensive,
and wondering what was coming.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I was going to say you haven't shown
me your passport.  I didn't ask you last night, as
it was so late."
</p>

<p>
"But I have not any," said Olivier, taken back.
Then, on second thoughts, he added&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That is to say, I left it in the country."
</p>

<p>
"You can easily procure one at the police section.
It is indispensable.  We cannot keep you here
without it.  That is the law now."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Olivier, forcing a smile, "Well,
to-morrow I will put everything right, for to-day I
have so much to do."
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow is <i>décadi</i>," the concierge remarked,
"and it would be difficult for you."
</p>

<p>
"Then the day after to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said the concierge, "but don't fail,
for I am responsible, you know."
</p>

<p>
Olivier thanked him and hastened away.  He
had not reckoned on such a complication.  If he
could only see his mother and his <i>fiancée</i>, what
mattered anything else?  He retraced his steps
towards the prison, this time taking the Rue de
l'Arcade, and finding himself suddenly opposite the
Madeleine, he turned into the Rue da la Révolution.
</p>

<p>
There he noticed an unusual stir, which increased
as he neared the Place de la Révolution.  The
streets appeared very gay, gayer than those he had
just left.  On looking up he saw that the houses
were decorated with tricolour scarves and flags, and
that men perched on ladders were hanging garlands
and foliage over the shop windows.  At the
entrance of the Place masts were being erected by a
continuous stream of journeymen and workmen,
with whom were mixed an increasing crowd of
onlookers.  Olivier thought of the previous day's
<i>fête</i>, and of the platforms he had helped to construct.
</p>

<p>
"So the Paris Democratic Society are having
their <i>fête</i> also," he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
On questioning a passer-by he was told that
preparations were being made for a festival in
honour of the Supreme Being, which was to take
place the next day on the Place de la Révolution.
Olivier had forgotten this in the confusion of his
mind, though he had heard it spoken of among his
comrades at the workshop.
</p>

<p>
The Festival of the Supreme Being!  The coming
triumph of Robespierre, the open parade of his
hypocrisy and pride, amidst the acclamations of a
servile multitude dominated by a tyrannical and
terrorising Dictator!
</p>

<p>
Olivier's whole soul revolted against the injustice
of human destiny which placed supreme power in
the hands of such a tyrant.  The image of his
mother and Thérèse, arrested by this man's orders,
rose again before his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he stopped.
</p>

<p>
On the Place de la Révolution, between the
statue of Liberty and the entrance to the Tuileries,
his astonished sight fell on an erection which, to all
appearance, was being taken down&mdash;cross-bars of
wood, lowered by the aid of ropes and pulleys, and
an enormous knife slowly descending.
</p>

<p>
Olivier turned pale, his knees shaking under him.
</p>

<p>
It was the guillotine!
</p>

<p>
The hideous, barbarous word breathing death&mdash;a
horrible, ghastly death&mdash;rang in his ears, and was
re-echoed by mock voices of despairing victims, the
guil ... lo ... tine&mdash;the guil ... lo
... tine&mdash;the guil ... lo ... tine.
</p>

<p>
Yes, this was the guillotine!
</p>

<p>
There it rose in front of him, the atrocious,
abominable machine, which had caused the best
blood of France to flow, the instrument of human
butchery, which had severed so many heads; there
it rose amidst the festive preparations, as a fearful
warning!
</p>

<p>
The knife continued its descent, slowly, silently,
mirroring the sun in blue metallic reflections, which
seemed to sparkle in its rays.  Olivier followed
every movement, with fascinated horror.
</p>

<p>
When the huge blade disappeared the young man
shook himself together with an effort, and seeing
a woman of the people passing, questioned her&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What was that?"
</p>

<p>
The woman was wary in her answer, the question
appeared to her so ingenuous.
</p>

<p>
"It's Madame Robespierre!"
</p>

<p>
"I know it is the guillotine," replied Olivier,
"but I wish to know what they are doing there."
</p>

<p>
"They are taking it away."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" he exclaimed, much relieved.
</p>

<p>
"But it is to be put up elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" he asked, again cast down.
</p>

<p>
"At the Place de la Bastille."  And she added
with a smile: "It seems there are still some
aristocrats to settle."
</p>

<p>
Olivier gave her an anxious, searching glance,
but reading mere ignorance in her eyes, he was
reassured, and began to wonder at the indifference of
this people, this simple, open-hearted race, which
had allowed themselves to be duped so many long
months.  He looked around him at the vast square
which, as the horrible scaffold was removed, wore
quite a festive air, smiling under its gay decorations
of flags and coloured devices and girandoles, which
were characteristic of the jovial humour and the
drollery of the French populace, always so light-hearted.
</p>

<p>
All this increased his own misery.
</p>

<p>
What?  Alone in the crowd, he must suffer,
alone he must lament!  He rebelled against it.
Was there no one to defy that infamous instrument
of torture which had been erected there as
an insult to human reason, and which was taken
down to be set up elsewhere?  It was indeed the
end of France!  Not one upright soul, not one
just man brave enough to cry with outraged
conscience: "Down with the scaffold!"  Not a single
Frenchman to be found to stay his fellow-countrymen,
ignorant of true justice, dupes of cruel men in
power, and to tear from their hands that ignoble
invention, that monument of death, and make a
bonfire of it all!  Perhaps many thought as he
did, but they dared not! ... No, they dared
not act!  And yet a spark was sufficient to inflame
the multitude, frivolous and easily led perhaps, but
withal so noble, so humane, so generous!
</p>

<p>
Olivier crossed the Place de la Révolution,
discouraged and down-hearted.  He followed the
parapet of the bridge without looking where he was
going, making his way unconsciously in the direction
of the Port-Royal quarter, where the prison
lay.
</p>

<p>
An unexpected sight awaited him before the
building.  People were briskly entering by the
principal door, moving gaily along with cardboard boxes,
baskets, and bags.  They were certainly neither
tradespeople nor officials, for some of them were
smartly dressed.  They were visitors, perhaps?
The thought filled him with joy.  Alas! if he
were mistaken!
</p>

<p>
On questioning a guard, his hopes were confirmed.
They were visitors, relations or friends of the
prisoners, admitted to see them and bring them sweets,
fruits, and change of clothes.
</p>

<p>
"You have some one there?" asked the man.
</p>

<p>
"My mother and my <i>fiancée</i>"
</p>

<p>
"You wish to see them?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any money?"
</p>

<p>
Olivier had already offered him a piece of gold.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! not for me, for the concierge," the man
protested as he beckoned to Olivier to follow him.
Passing through the gateway, he presented him to
the concierge, a little man, thick set, brisk, and sly,
who, seeing them in the distance, had understood
Olivier's object, and now asked him the name of the
prisoners he wished to see.
</p>

<p>
"The citoyennes Durand?  Very good!  Follow
me.  They must be in the Acacia Court;" and
turning round, he added&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Here is a card which you will return to me
when you come out."
</p>

<p>
He then crossed a dark, narrow corridor, and
stopped before an iron grating, which he opened
for Olivier to pass in.  As he showed him the
courtyard he said laughing&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You will recognise them, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
And he went away, shutting the grating.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE PRISON OF LA BOURSE
</h3>

<p>
Olivier found himself on the threshold of a vast
courtyard enclosed by high walls, and by two
enormous stone and brick buildings with cross-barred
windows.  The roof of these buildings was bordered
by a spiked fence, in order, as it seemed, to make
escape impossible.  These were the very structures
he had seen from the street.  They were connected
by a stone corridor with a terrace at the end, running
parallel with it, where a sentinel patrolled with
shouldered arms.  The entrance to this corridor
was secured by an enormous grating, which when
opened put the courtyard in which Olivier now
stood in communication with another open space
planted with trees.
</p>

<p>
The young man advanced with some hesitation,
for he saw some of the prisoners walking in the
shade of an acacia, whose blossoms were bathed in
the rosy light of the setting sun.  A mound of grass
surrounding the tree lent rustic freshness to the
scene.
</p>

<p>
Olivier scanned these moving groups with beating
heart, anxiously examining every one that passed
him.  There were men, women, and even children.
But he had recognised no one.  His mother and
Thérèse apparently were not there.
</p>

<p>
He would have questioned some one but dared
not, vaguely fearing to compromise his dear ones,
forgetting that the people before him were also
prisoners, and their companions in suffering and
misfortune.  Just then a young woman, pretty
and graceful in her simple toilet, wearing a white
cambric cap finely goffered, came briskly towards
him.
</p>

<p>
"You are perhaps looking for some one?" she
said in a sweet voice.
</p>

<p>
"My mother and my <i>fiancée</i>, the citoyennes
Durand."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! they are still at table!  Look, the young
girl will not eat, and the elder lady is trying to
persuade her."
</p>

<p>
In his hesitation to advance further Olivier had
not perceived, on the other side of the acacia, a table
laid with coarse earthenware, which was being
cleared by several turnkeys and waiters, and at
which a few prisoners still lingered.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it was they, his beloved ones, at last!
Olivier remained dumb, divided between his longing
to hold them in his arms and the fear of taking
them too brusquely by surprise.  His unknown ally
seemed to divine his feelings, for she said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If you like, I will go first to them."  Then, as
if to reassure him, she introduced herself: "I am
the Countess de Narbonne."
</p>

<p>
Olivier, deeply moved, thanked her in broken
phrases, and followed his friendly guide at a
distance.  Soon she was whispering in Clarisse's ear,
as if preparing her for the unexpected visit.  Clarisse
turned round, and seeing her son, grew deadly pale.
She rose and fell into his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Arrested?  You also, my son?"
</p>

<p>
He pressed her to him, reassuring her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no! ... I am free! ... Be at peace,
mother ... I have had permission to see you."
</p>

<p>
He then kissed Thérèse, who, still trembling,
asked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Is it really true, you are free?"
</p>

<p>
Olivier again reassured them.  Clarisse wished
to find a secluded spot where they could talk
undisturbed, and Thérèse having espied an empty bench
under another acacia, they took possession of it.
</p>

<p>
Olivier now anxiously questioned his mother,
wanting to know every detail of her arrest, but
Clarisse interrupted him.  He must first tell them
about himself.  Was he really safe?  How did he
get to Paris?  Where was he staying?  Olivier
was obliged to answer, telling them his adventures
as quickly as possible, that he might return to their
arrest.  When he had satisfied them, he asked
breathlessly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And you?  Tell me everything.  I must know all."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse then told him of their arrest, departure,
and halt at Montmorency; of the long drive to
Paris, their arrival in the prison more dead than
alive, and how they gained heart on learning it was
one of the least cruel in Paris.  She had been able
to judge for herself when she awoke in the morning,
and was so cordially received by her fellow-prisoners,
men and women who, as she discovered on their
introducing themselves, belonged to her world.
</p>

<p>
She then pointed out to Olivier among those
taking their after-dinner promenade Madame de
Narbonne, so gentle, so compassionate, and her little
girl, such a darling child! then the Count and
Countess de Lavergne; the Marquise de Choiseul,
who had taken such kind and delicate interest in
Thérèse at breakfast; the whole family de
Malussie; the Count de Broglie; the Chevalier de Bar;
the Maréchal de Mouchy and his lady, whom
Clarisse had met in her youth at Versailles;
Mademoiselle de Béthisy, and the Marquis d'Avaux.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, with a sad smile.  "I have not
found myself in such elegant company since we left
Pontivy."
</p>

<p>
"That is easily explained," replied Olivier; "the
prisons of the Republic are used only for the
nobility."
</p>

<p>
"You are mistaken," Clarisse answered gently.
"Among the prisoners there are, I can assure you,
men and women of the lower middle-class, who have
given proofs of the highest nobility of soul."
</p>

<p>
"That is exactly what I mean&mdash;they are eminent
in virtue, as the others are in birth.  And they
are consequently not wanted.  All that is wanted is
equality....  Equality in infamy!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  Be quiet, you may be heard!"
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet?  I shall be quiet when they tell me
of what you are accused; for, after all, why have
you been arrested?  What have you done?"
</p>

<p>
"That is just what we ask ourselves," answered
Clarisse.  And then she continued as if she were
thinking aloud&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"At first I fancied that some one had denounced
us, but I put that thought aside at once, for who
could have done so?"
</p>

<p>
"Who?" exclaimed Olivier, astonished that his
mother as yet knew nothing.  Looking at her fixedly,
he continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What!  Is it possible they have not told you?"
</p>

<p>
"Told me?  Who could tell me? ... Then
it was...?" she asked breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"It was Robespierre!"
</p>

<p>
She bounded from her seat as if under an electric
shock.  Incredulous and stupefied, she protested in
spite of herself.
</p>

<p>
"It is not true!" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"How can it not be true?  Leonard heard it
from the driver who took you to Paris.  Robespierre
was a few yards off our house at the Carrefour de la
Chèvre.  It was from that very spot he set his agents
upon you."
</p>

<p>
These details brought back the scene to Clarisse's
memory.  And she thought of Vaughan, undoubtedly
arrested also.
</p>

<p>
Olivier recalled her to the present, continuing to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was Robespierre, the infamous wretch!"
</p>

<p>
She threw herself on him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no!  Hush!  I implore you!"
</p>

<p>
He struggled to continue, but she prevented him,
trying to drown his words.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you are mistaken....  Leonard is
mistaken....  It is certain....  I should have
known....  If it were he ... I should have known!"
</p>

<p>
"No!  You could not have known.  You yourself
said so just now.  Why should they account to
you for their actions?  It is he ... he and no
other!"
</p>

<p>
And Olivier then gave her minutely every detail
as the gardener had told it to him.  How one of the
agents had conferred with Robespierre after the
arrest, at the Carrefour de la Chèvre, where he was
enjoying a picnic.
</p>

<p>
Ah!  Clarisse needed no such explanations.  It
was he, she knew it too well.  But how was she to
persuade Olivier to the contrary?  How prevent
the son from cursing his father?
</p>

<p>
She tried to excuse Robespierre, attributing to him
other motives.
</p>

<p>
"You see," she said, "he doesn't know who we
are....  He is mistaken....  His agents have
misled him....  There could be so many
misunderstandings...."
</p>

<p>
Olivier shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"How credulous you are!  Bah! he knows
very well what he is doing!  It is his thirst for
blood.  Oh! you don't half know what he is, that
Rob...."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, horror-stricken, put her fingers to his lips,
to arrest the words.
</p>

<p>
"No!  No!  Don't pronounce that name in
such a way!"
</p>

<p>
And seeing him look at her in bewilderment, she
tried to give him plausible reasons.
</p>

<p>
"You might be heard, and you would be compromised."
</p>

<p>
"But how?  Here?  Where everybody holds
his name in execration?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but then there are turnkeys coming and
going at every moment.  And what if there are
spies among the prisoners...?"
</p>

<p>
And, as if clutching at a straw, she followed up
the idea.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, spies&mdash;traitors?  You must not betray
your feelings before them."
</p>

<p>
"True! there is no lack of infamy among the
populace!"
</p>

<p>
He then told his mother of the incidents of his
wanderings in Paris, of his utter astonishment at
the apathy of the crowd round that accursed scaffold
which was being transported to the Place de la
Bastille, amidst the preparations for the Festival of
the Supreme Being.
</p>

<p>
And yet he knew that much of their indifference
must be assumed.  How many thought as he did!
How many had the long-awaited cry of deliverance
on their lips: "Down with the scaffold!"  Only
they dared not speak out!  If but one had the
courage to give utterance to that cry, there would
be enough brave men found in the crowd to take
it up and re-echo it, carrying the more timid along
with them.  When once a move is made the
multitude will quickly follow.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse looked at him.  A new thought had
dawned on her mind, a horrible thought!
</p>

<p>
What if Robespierre should have Olivier arrested
without knowing who he was?
</p>

<p>
She interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"Is the house where you lodge quite safe?"
</p>

<p>
As Olivier replied in the affirmative, and was
continuing the narrative of his adventures, she took
up the thread of his thoughts.  Suddenly a gleam
of hope shone in her eyes, as if her mental
speculations had assured her.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I did well to write to him!" she thought.
</p>

<p>
To him, to Robespierre!  For she had written to
the Incorruptible that very morning.
</p>

<p>
She now turned this letter over in her mind, in
which she had informed him of her imprisonment,
telling him her fears about her son, whose age she
particularly mentioned as nineteen years.  It was a
hint for Robespierre, who would understand, and
perhaps be touched to pity, and set her and Marie
Thérèse at liberty, and spare the lad who was her
son and his own.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse had confided this letter to a prisoner set
at liberty, whom she earnestly entreated to see it
safely delivered.
</p>

<p>
"It will be the easiest thing in the world," the
man had replied; "you can be quite at rest."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse did not suspect the irony of this reply,
or that the supposed prisoner was one of the spies to
whom she had unwittingly alluded a little while
before.  Ah, yes; she could be at rest, truly!  The
letter would reach Robespierre.  But under what
conditions?  He, who received so many!  Alas!
It is in the wounded heart that most illusions take
root!  Clarisse did not dream that anything could
interfere with her scheme, and began to speculate
on the future, counting the hours, and saying to
herself that in all probability the letter could reach
Robespierre the next day.
</p>

<p>
The best she could do till then, she thought, was
to moderate Olivier's zeal, by showing him that
their prison-life was not so unbearable; and she
imagined it would distract him if she presented him
to some of her companions in misfortune.  They
had just taken away the tables, so making the
courtyard appear larger, and leaving more room for the
promenade.  Olivier was now noticing more clearly
the people in this little prison-world taking air and
exercise in the open space to which the green
acacia-trees gave some semblance of a garden.
</p>

<p>
The women, dressed simply in summer toilets,
retained an air of elegance in spite of the plain
ribbon band fastening their hair, and their fresh,
newly ironed caps.  The men were gay and smiling,
polite and distinguished; they talked and played
cards or chess together on the benches, exchanging
courtesies as if they were in a drawing-room.
"After you! ... I should not think of it! ..."  And
in and out the groups the concierge Haly came
and went, giving his orders, accompanied by two
bulldogs, with enormous spiked collars.
</p>

<p>
Just then a fair-haired, bright-eyed boy of fifteen
knocked up against Olivier.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! pardon, monsieur!" said the lad, who was
playing a game of fives and running after the ball.
</p>

<p>
"What a nice lad!" said Olivier.
</p>

<p>
"It's young de Maillé," said Thérèse.  "Nobody
knows why he has been arrested.  His doom
is settled, however, for they say he threw a rotten
herring at the head of the concierge."
</p>

<p>
Here Clarisse stopped her.
</p>

<p>
"So they say, but it is not true, for the concierge
is a fairly honest fellow."
</p>

<p>
And addressing a lady who was just passing, she
continued, "Is it not so, madame?  Haly is not a
bad fellow, is he?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but a blockhead; a lamb, however, compared
to the jailers of other prisons."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse thus presented Olivier: "My son&mdash;Madame
la Marquise de Choiseul."
</p>

<p>
Olivier bowed courteously, and as Madame de
Choiseul, struck by the distinguished air of the
young workman, held out her hand, Olivier took it
in his and kissed it.  In this high-born company
all the grace of his early education came back to him.
</p>

<p>
The marquise smiled and turned to Clarisse.
</p>

<p>
"Behold a son who betrays his mother!  Your
name is not Durand.  You belong to us.  I had
thought as much."
</p>

<p>
And as Clarisse was about to reply, she added:
"Hush!  I am not asking your secrets."
</p>

<p>
She then assured the young man that his mother
was right: the concierge Haly, though rough, was
rather kind than otherwise, letting visitors enter, and
even bring in provisions, sweets, and linen.
</p>

<p>
"And above all," she added, "he does us the
great favour of letting us walk about and disport
ourselves here until night time."
</p>

<p>
She then pointed out to Olivier the various games
in which the men and children took part.
</p>

<p>
"As you see," she added, "they take full advantage
of the permission."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, well pleased with the tone of the
conversation, tried to retain the marquise.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him, madame, how you pass your evenings."
</p>

<p>
"What!  Have you not yet told him?" asked
the marquise, who had been a silent spectator of the
meeting between the mother and her son.
</p>

<p>
"You must not forget that I only arrived yesterday,"
said Clarisse.  "I know nothing myself but
what I have heard."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, true!" said Madame de Choiseul, who
with a mother's heart now understood Clarisse's
kindly motive.
</p>

<p>
At once she pointed out to Olivier the windows
of one of the buildings.
</p>

<p>
"That is what we call our drawing-room&mdash;a
large apartment in which we gather in the evening.
There we play at guessing riddles, charades, and
<i>bouts-rimés</i>.  Some read verses, or recite to us, and
we even have music.  Look!  Do you see that
gentleman seated over there under an arch, turning
the pages of an album?  That is the Baron de
Wyrbach, who plays some charming airs every
evening on his <i>viola d'amoré</i>.  He exhausts his
ingenuity to find something new for us."
</p>

<p>
Olivier listened in astonishment, beginning to be
really reassured.
</p>

<p>
"You see," continued the marquise, "we might
imagine ourselves still at Versailles."
</p>

<p>
Then she added with a sad smile&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And so we are in one sense, for all that remains
of Versailles is now in prison."
</p>

<p>
And she mentioned many names, singling out
among the prisoners those who belonged to the old
Court: the Prince and Princess de Saint-Maurice,
the Chevalier de Pons, and the Count d'Armaille,
whose nephew, young d'Hauteville, had been a page
to Louis XVI.
</p>

<p>
A group had formed round a young woman
seated on the grassy knoll, her back against the
acacia, fanning herself daintily.
</p>

<p>
"Look now!  Would you not think it a court
of love in one of the groves of Trianon?  It is
Madame de Méré receiving the homage of her
admirers."
</p>

<p>
Madame de Méré rose at that moment to meet
another lady who was coming towards her, pretty,
neat, and natty in her spotless toilet; and Madame
de Choiseul explained to Olivier who the newcomer was.
</p>

<p>
"That is Madame de Verneuil, who remains,
though in prison, as coquettish and as fashionably
dressed as she used to be at Court.  She even finds
time to make her usual change of toilet regularly
three times a day, without the assistance of maid or
hairdresser.  Not only does she dress herself, and do
her own hair, but she washes, dries, and gets up her
own linen!  And all this in such good-humour that
it brings tears to one's eyes."
</p>

<p>
Olivier was now quite reassured with regard to
the severity of the prison rules to which his mother
and Thérèse were subjected.  He was, nevertheless,
astonished at the careless indifference which he saw
around him.  If the populace had revolted him on
the Place de la Révolution, this aristocratic company
in the prison dumfounded him.  He could not hide
his feelings, or refrain from expressing his surprise;
but he did so respectfully, with tact, and in perfectly
good taste.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse essayed to interrupt him; but Madame
de Choiseul had already replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You have just come from the country, perhaps,
and have not mixed in the Parisian world for some
time.  What you take for indifference is in reality
mere habit.  You cannot change the French people.
The moment they find a struggle useless, they gaily
make the best of it.  Believe me, their seeming
frivolity only masks the resignation of a Stoic.  There
are still rebellious and desperate spirits to be found,
but they are in a minority.  The majority are heart-sick
and ready to go, that is, to die; and they do die
with a smile on their lips, French to the last!"
</p>

<p>
Voices and sounds of applause interrupted the
marquise, and cries of "Bravo!  Bravo!  That was
very good!" were heard.  A young girl, her arms
tied behind her back, was bowing from the top of a
ladder on which she was standing, and to which she
had mounted by the aid of chairs and stools placed
upon tables and benches.  As she tried to descend
all arms proffered assistance, and when she had
reached the ground another lady came forward, the
Marquise d'Avaux, whom Madame de Choiseul
named to Olivier, and began to climb the improvised
ascent with faltering steps.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, Thérèse, and Olivier watched this
performance, understanding nothing of it.  Madame de
Choiseul looked at them to note their expression, and
with one accord the three turned to question her&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That is a new game, is it not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and a rather gloomy one," answered
Madame de Choiseul.  Then she added solemnly,
"Those ladies are learning how to walk to the
scaffold."
</p>

<p>
She explained to them that the wooden steps
which the condemned had to climb to reach the
guillotine were difficult to ascend.  The women
encountered serious obstacles in mounting, being
without the assistance of their hands, which were
tied behind them.  They stumbled and slipped, their
dresses sometimes catching in the woodwork, to the
great amusement of the rabble crowd.
</p>

<p>
"It is to avoid these accidents," she said, "and
to be able to meet their martyrdom respected by the
mob, that they rehearse the role which they may be
called upon to play on the morrow, perhaps, in
public."
</p>

<p>
Olivier was dumb with admiration before this
contempt of the scaffold, the general resignation to
the thought of death.
</p>

<p>
Presently peals of laughter were heard.  The
Marquise d'Avaux, just before reaching the last stool,
caught her dress on the back of a chair.  She
laughed with the rest, and said gaily, showing her
torn skirt&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Some more work for this evening!"
</p>

<p>
"You see," continued Madame de Choiseul,
"what the indifference which revolted you so much
just now hides in reality.  Many of those young
women keep up the failing courage of the men at
the scaffold, and offer to die first."
</p>

<p>
But Clarisse, whose curiosity was now satisfied,
tried to turn attention from these gloomy subjects,
her mother's heart telling her they would reawaken
Olivier's apprehensions.  She soon found a pretext.
Madame de Narbonne passed them with her little
girl, holding a basket of fruit, of which the child
partook without restraint.
</p>

<p>
"What lovely cherries!" exclaimed Clarisse.
</p>

<p>
Madame de Narbonne stopped to offer her some,
but Clarisse declined, and when pressed, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Not for me, thanks; but my niece will perhaps
taste them."
</p>

<p>
When Thérèse also asked to be excused, Olivier
intervened.
</p>

<p>
"Only taste," he said, and as she still declined,
"Will you allow me, mademoiselle?" he asked,
taking a bunch from the basket which the child now
carried.  And he held one of the cherries up to his
<i>fiancée's</i> lips.  "Won't you take one to please me?"
</p>

<p>
Clarisse could not help smiling.  Olivier saw the
smile.  "And you, also, mamma!" he said.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse allowed herself to be persuaded, looking
gratefully at the kind prisoner to whose good nature
that little family scene was due, and Olivier was
beginning to renew his playful persuasions to
Thérèse, when a bell sounded from behind the big
grating, tolling slowly.
</p>

<p>
Madame de Narbonne turned pale.
</p>

<p>
"The call!" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
All conversation now ceased; men and women
fell into groups, or left each other abruptly, looking
anxiously towards the iron gate, as if expecting
some one to appear.  Olivier felt the universal
shudder of dread, and his fears were again awakened.
</p>

<p>
"The call!  What call!" he asked.
</p>

<p>
But the Marquise de Choiseul had gone away
with Madame de Narbonne, carrying the little child
along with them, in great haste.  Olivier, turning
round, met only the supplicating look of his mother,
who had perhaps understood.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she said, with an effort.
</p>

<p>
Thérèse clung tremblingly to Clarisse, feeling
that something terrible was to happen, and Olivier
going towards one of the prisoners to question him
was soon joined by Clarisse and Thérèse.
</p>

<p>
"The call?  Why, it is the summons to such
of the prisoners as are destined to appear before the
Revolutionary Tribunal.  The bell had been rung
to assemble all the prisoners to meet the Recorder,
who, with list in hand, will read the names of those
selected by the Revolutionary Tribunal for trial."
</p>

<p>
"You mean for condemnation!" interrupted
Olivier, with indignation.
</p>

<p>
The prisoner nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
"So all those who are named..."
</p>

<p>
"Will be taken in a cart to the Conciergerie,
and..."
</p>

<p>
"And?"
</p>

<p>
"Ascend the scaffold two days after," said the
prisoner in conclusion, apparently resigned to his
fate.
</p>

<p>
"Then it may be one of us, mamma?" asked
Thérèse, bursting into tears.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse tried to master her emotion.
</p>

<p>
"No..." she said.  "It's too soon
... isn't it? ... tell her..."
</p>

<p>
And she implored Olivier with a look.
</p>

<p>
"How can one know?" he said, driven to distraction.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no! ... I assure you! ... You will
see....  It is impossible! ..."
</p>

<p>
And still she murmured brokenly: "You will
see....  It is impossible! ..."
</p>

<p>
The Recorder of the Revolutionary Tribunal
now passed the grating, accompanied by Haly, the
concierge, and followed by turnkeys and gendarmes,
who, on entering the courtyard, formed themselves
in line.  The Recorder was a little man, fat and
full-blooded, his face twisted into a sly, ugly smile.
He seemed highly amused at the spectacle, and
seated himself under the acacia, talking to the
concierge, who seemed surprised to see him, and
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I thought the Tribunal would not sit to-morrow
on account of the Festival of the Supreme Being?"
</p>

<p>
"You are right!  But they will sit the day after
to-morrow.  You understand, I want to be free
to-morrow and to take part in the festival...."
</p>

<p>
And with a cynical laugh he called for a glass of
wine, which he emptied at a draught.
</p>

<p>
"Attention!  We must begin business!" he
said; and with this he unfolded the paper, the
terrible paper, wherein the fate of the victims had been
decided in advance.  But the day was near its close, the
Recorder could not see, and had to ask for a lantern.
</p>

<p>
The courtyard was full now.
</p>

<p>
Prisoners from the neighbouring yards had assembled
in answer to the call.  All this little world was
affected by various feelings; some were resigned,
some hopeful, some indifferent or frightened as they
looked at the messenger of death, who seemed quite
unconscious of his ignominy.
</p>

<p>
What names would fall from his lips?  There
were some, worn out and weary, looking forward to
death as a release, who would have willingly put
theirs into his mouth.  Others, more feeble, who
were undergoing the full horrors of suspense, stood
in breathless fear, almost choked with anguish.
Oh! that horrible hope of hearing another's name
called, rather than one's own!  And yet...
</p>

<p>
The Recorder was becoming impatient.
</p>

<p>
"Where is that lantern!" he shouted.  "Is
every one asleep here?"
</p>

<p>
A few of the prisoners had refrained from joining
the anxious crowd; either from habit or indifference,
without disturbing themselves, they continued playing
or conversing as before.  Clarisse and Thérèse
were seated at a little distance, their eyes fixed on
the dread official, while Olivier, standing near, ready
to defend them, watched the affecting scene with
strained anxiety.
</p>

<p>
The Recorder was swearing now.
</p>

<p>
"Is that cursed lantern never coming?  So
much the worse!  I shall commence without it."
</p>

<p>
And he rose and tried to decipher the names in
the dark.
</p>

<p>
"The first name is Bour ... no, Lour..."
</p>

<p>
Here a voice interrupted him in indignant protest.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! don't read like that!  You double their
sufferings.  It is horrible! too horrible!"
</p>

<p>
It was Olivier.
</p>

<p>
"Who dares to speak here?" thundered the
Recorder.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse desperately pulled her son by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"I implore you! ... my child! ... I do
implore you!"
</p>

<p>
At that moment some one appeared with a light.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! there's the lantern!" cried the concierge.
</p>

<p>
When the man had explained that he had not
been able to find any matches, the Recorder began
to read the paper&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Sourdeval!" he cried out.
</p>

<p>
Other lanterns were now lighting up the courtyard
and the distracted crowd, and every eye was
turned in the direction of the prisoner who had been
named.
</p>

<p>
"Here I am!" cried a voice.
</p>

<p>
And a man advanced, his head erect, calm and
impassive, without casting a single glance on the
spectators, knowing no one perhaps.  He crossed
the line of gendarmes, and disappeared behind the
grating to fetch his belongings.
</p>

<p>
The Recorder proceeded with his grim and
gloomy task, drawing tears from some, heart-rending
cries from others, and interrupted by murmurs of
pity or defiance.
</p>

<p>
The young de Maillé, who was called among the
first, stopped playing with the children to go to his
death.  An old man, Monsieur de Mauclère, at the
sound of his name fainted away, and was carried
out.  Madame de Narbonne, called also, confided
her little daughter to Madame de Choiseul.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going, mamma?" asked the child.
</p>

<p>
And Madame de Narbonne had the courage to reply&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I shall be back in a moment, my darling."
</p>

<p>
"Don't go, mamma! ... don't go! ... I
don't want you to go!"
</p>

<p>
Madame de Narbonne hurried away to hide her
tears, then, breaking down entirely, leant on the
grating and sobbed aloud.
</p>

<p>
The Maleyssie family, father, mother, and two
young girls, threw themselves into each other's arms,
thanking heaven they were not to be separated in
this supreme hour, and would walk hand in hand to
the scaffold.  An old couple with white hair, the
Maréchal and Maréchale de Mouchy, worn with age,
each walking with the aid of a stick, were called
together.  At once she took his arm, and so they
made their way with calm courage through the
prisoners, who bared their heads in reverence before
such sublime resignation.  Another couple drew
forth cries of admiration: the Comte and Comtesse
de Lavergne.  The Comte, alone named, was taking
leave of his wife, who, after assuring herself she
was not on the list, implored the Recorder to include
her.  On his replying that he had no orders to do
so, she uttered the cry of sedition punishable by
death: "Vive le Roi!" and was inscribed forthwith
on the fatal list.
</p>

<p>
Olivier now held his mother pressed against him,
while Marie Thérèse and Clarisse, nestling together,
followed the terrible spectacle with joined hands.
All hearts were moved to admiration or to pity,
according to the acts of courage or faint-heartedness
which were displayed.  But brave deeds
predominated.  A Monsieur de Gournay, called out
whilst engaged in filling his pipe on a bench, rose
quietly and lit it at a turnkey's lantern, and went
towards the gate without a word.  The Comte de
Broglie, interrupted in a game of chess with the
Chevalier de Bar, as he rose pointed to the
chess-board, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You see, you would have lost, chevalier.  But
cheer up!  I shall let you have your revenge in the
other world."
</p>

<p>
Then, calm and composed, taking leave of the
chevalier, bowing to his acquaintances, kissing the
hands of the Marquise d'Avaux and of Madame de
Méré, he followed the gendarmes to his fate.
</p>

<p>
A discussion was taking place near to where
Olivier was standing over a name which had just
been called.
</p>

<p>
"Leguay!"
</p>

<p>
Two men were speaking to each other; one was
of middle age, turning grey; the other quite young.
</p>

<p>
"Are you also Leguay?" asked the young man,
who when his name was called was surprised to see
his fellow-prisoner advancing with him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
"Are you married, or a bachelor?"
</p>

<p>
"Married, and father of two children."
</p>

<p>
"I am a soldier, and have neither wife nor child....
Go no further."
</p>

<p>
The Recorder, who was growing impatient at the
conversation of the two men, whom he took for
relations taking leave of each other, shouted&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well!  Leguay?"
</p>

<p>
"It is I," answered the young man.
</p>

<p>
Only Olivier, Clarisse, and Thérèse had witnessed
this sublime self-devotion.  Olivier made a
movement as if to offer his hand to the young hero, but
he had already crossed over to the gendarmes.
</p>

<p>
The Recorder now scribbled something on the
list, and the people expected him to commence a
new series.  But he folded the paper, and after
asking for another glass of wine, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That is all for to-day."
</p>

<p>
At these words an immediate feeling of relief
ran through the crowd, awakening them from that
terrible nightmare.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" said Clarisse, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"And you told me you were quite safe!"
exclaimed Olivier.
</p>

<p>
Again she had the courage to conceal the truth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! my anxiety was for others, not for
ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Olivier shook his head incredulously, and was
about to reply, when the voice of Haly announcing
the hour for the visitors to leave interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"All visitors out!  It is time to close!"
</p>

<p>
The Recorder by this time disappeared, preceded
by gendarmes.  The prancing of horses was heard
in the neighbouring courtyard, amidst a confusion
of orders and counter-orders.  It was the men on
duty who were putting the prisoners in the cart,
now ready to start.  Haly, posted at the grating of
the gate by which Olivier had entered, received the
cards of the visitors, examining them by the light
of his lantern, which he suspiciously lifted to a level
with their faces.
</p>

<p>
Olivier did not hurry his departure, in spite of the
insistence of his mother, who was terrified at the
thought that the gate might shut on him.  But
the concierge saw him.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  You there!  If you want to stay, you
know, you have only to say so."
</p>

<p>
"He is coming!" cried the two women.
</p>

<p>
And kissing him quickly, they pushed him towards
the gate.
</p>

<p>
Olivier, before leaving, had promised his mother
not to try and see them for some days, but to rest
satisfied with writing, without giving his address.
</p>

<p>
The two women glanced in spite of themselves
at the neighbouring courtyard, whence came a
noise of wheels and the tramp of horses.  They
stooped, and saw through the large grating the cart
with its load of the condemned roll away by the
light of torches held by the turnkeys, and driven
by a coachman in a carmagnole and red bonnet.
As the vehicle was disappearing the two women
recognised Madame de Narbonne in tears, sending
kisses to the prison, in which her little girl had
now wept herself to sleep.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! it is horrible!" said Thérèse.
</p>

<p>
And she fell on Clarisse's shoulder, thoroughly
broken by the terrible emotions of the day.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the cart reached the street, and
passed close to Olivier, who commenced mechanically
to follow it, while the people of the quarter,
seated at their doors, and accustomed to this daily
spectacle, looked on with indifference.  But at a
bend in the road Olivier let the cart go out of sight,
lost in reflection.  He walked straight on as a man
in a dream, stopping on the quay to look down at
the Seine.  The cooling freshness of the water
seemed to revive him.  He breathed the air gratefully,
and continued his walk along the river, feeling
less depressed.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly from the heights of Port-Royal his eyes
were dazzled by a rush of unusual light.  Showers
of golden fire trailed in the air over the Tuileries
gardens.  It was a trial of the fireworks to be let
off the next day.  Olivier crossed the bridge, and
hastening his steps reached the Place de la Révolution,
which at that hour was filled with loungers
from the boulevards, curious to see the preparations
for the <i>fête</i>.  Under a sky studded with stars, the
immense space lay extended before him, with its
stands already decked with flowers; its masts
connected by garlands of foliage and coloured glass;
its flags, and plumes, and banners floating in the
wind.
</p>

<p>
Here and there fiddlers, standing on chairs, taught
to choirs of young girls and young men the new
anthem by Gossec, to be sung at the <i>fête</i>, a hymn
to the Supreme Being, composed specially for the
occasion.  Some, carried away by their enthusiasm,
followed up the hymn with a waltz or a gavotte.
</p>

<p>
Olivier opened his eyes in astonishment, asking
himself if all this was real, or if he was in an
extravagant dream.  On one side he saw but sorrow,
on the other only joy!  On one side, tears, despair,
and the scaffold; on the other, laughter, revelry, and
flowers!  And the laughter and flowers were to
honour and glorify the very one who was the cause of
all this misery, who tore children relentlessly from
the arms of their mothers as he sent them to death!
</p>

<p>
At this very moment the abhorred name fell on
his ears: "Robespierre! ... There's Robespierre!"
he heard the crowd whispering.
</p>

<p>
He turned round and saw some of them looking
curiously at a man who was crossing the square,
seemingly in great haste, with a woman leaning on
his arm.  Olivier understood that it was the
Incorruptible who was passing within barely an arm's
length of him!  He watched him disappear in the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
They were right; it was Robespierre, who had
been enjoying a walk in the Champs-Elysées with
Cornélie Duplay.  Returning home to supper, at
Duplay's house in the Rue Saint-Honoré, he could
not resist crossing the square to have a foretaste of
the rejoicings in honour of <i>his fête</i>, to contemplate
behind the curtain the scene of his approaching
triumph.  Cornélie had just said to him in delight,
indicating the dancing groups,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The people seem to be devoted to it, heart and
soul."
</p>

<p>
This flattered Robespierre's pride, who rewarded
her with a gentle pressure of the arm.
</p>

<p>
They continued their walk, deep in their own
thoughts.  Cornélie was wondering if her dress
would be at home when she arrived, that beautiful
dress for the <i>fête</i>, confided on this special occasion
to a private dressmaker.  Robespierre, always
suspicious and alert, was asking himself if he had done
well to listen to her, and thus cross the Place de la
Révolution at the risk of suggesting to the Committee
of Public Safety the idea, absurd in itself, that
he had wished to attract the notice of the populace.
</p>

<p>
The couple now reached the door of the Duplays,
in the Rue Saint-Honoré, and Robespierre stepped
aside gallantly for Cornélie to pass in.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment Olivier, who had stopped in
deep thought at the Place de la Révolution, retraced
his steps homeward, fired with a sudden resolution
for the morrow.
</p>

<p>
"I will be at that <i>fête</i>," he said.
</p>

<p>
And the dark night swallowed him.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
THE FÊTE OF THE SUPREME BEING
</h3>

<p>
The Duplays' house, in which Robespierre
lodged, was situated in the Rue Saint-Honoré,
opposite the Church of the Assumption.  The front
door opened on to a large vaulted passage littered
with planks propped up against the wall.  At the
end of this a small courtyard was formed by the
quadrangular shape of the two-storied house.  The
first floor was occupied by the Duplay couple and
their two daughters, Cornélie and Victoire.  The
ground floor was divided into three rooms, including
the dining-room and the drawing-room.  Robespierre
lived in a room on the first floor of the left
wing, which formed one side of the quadrangle.
The ground floor of this wing, along which ran a
shed, was used by the old Duplay as a carpenter's
workshop.  Robespierre's window was above the
carpenter's shed, one room, and his quarters were
connected with the main building by means of a
wooden staircase, which led from his room to the
dining-room.  He was thus well guarded on one
side by the Duplay family, as he was on the other
by young Maurice Duplay and Simon, the
wooden-legged, who occupied two rooms on a line with
Robespierre's, which also looked on to the shed.
</p>

<p>
It would have been certainly difficult for Robespierre
to find a house more suited to his craving for
an ostentatious display of Republican simplicity.
The joiner's bench, the planks and tools littering
the courtyard, the shed full of workmen during the
day, sawing, piecing, and planing; the personal
appearance of old Duplay, who only put aside his apron
to come to table, or to go to the Jacobin Club, at
which he was a constant attendant, or to the
Revolutionary Tribunal, where he acted as deputy
jury-man&mdash;all this marked the simple and industrious
surroundings in which he lived.
</p>

<p>
Two of his colleagues at the Convention had
been lately received in the courtyard by Cornélie
Duplay, who was hanging out some stockings to
dry; and Robespierre had enjoyed their surprise
from the window of his room, where he was
shaving himself.  He was suspected of aiming at the
Dictatorship!  Was he?  And this was the spectacle
which met the astonished eyes of visitors who
surprised him in his private life!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre and Cornélie had been received at
the door by Blount, who barked and gambolled
with joy at his master's return.  The Duplay
family, cooling themselves in the courtyard, were
awaiting their return.
</p>

<p>
"Here they are at last!" some one cried.
</p>

<p>
It was mother Duplay, seated in the background
under the dining-room window, washing a salad
under the pump, her sleeves tucked up to the
elbow, all ears for the slightest sound.
</p>

<p>
"But we are not late, mamma!" said Cornélie,
who had prudently stopped to avoid being splashed.
</p>

<p>
"Not so very," answered the good woman, "but
one never knows what may happen in such a
crowd!"  And looking towards Robespierre, from
whom Victoire was taking his hat and stick, she
added: "You can't help being anxious about people
you love.  Can you?"
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre was for the moment entirely
occupied with his dog, who barked and jumped
on his master in frantic delight.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you good old dog, here I
am! ... Yes! ... Yes! ... I couldn't take you with
me, because of the crowd.  It isn't fit for a good
dog like you."
</p>

<p>
"Then there were many people?" asked Duplay,
who smoked his pipe, seated on a joiner's bench
near little Maurice, his son, who was amusing
himself by planing a small plank.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a great many."
</p>

<p>
"An enormous crowd," added Cornélie,
"particularly on the Place de la Révolution."
</p>

<p>
"What!  You crossed the Place de la Révolution?"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre hastened to explain that Cornélie had
had a fancy to come that way, which was, after all,
excusable, as the people were dancing.
</p>

<p>
"What!  Already?" asked Victoire, her eyes
sparkling.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, already!" said Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
And he told them all about their walk through
the strange crowd, so lively and so full of enthusiasm,
turning now and then to Cornélie for corroboration.
But Cornélie wore an absent air, replying
only in monosyllables, for she had just learnt that
her dress had not yet arrived; though she took some
comfort on hearing that her sisters were in no better
plight.
</p>

<p>
Mother Duplay, with arms akimbo, lingered to listen
with enraptured interest to Robespierre's narrative.
</p>

<p>
"I said as much to Duplay!  It will be a triumph."
</p>

<p>
Duplay here interrupted her.
</p>

<p>
"Well, are we to have supper to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"You may well ask, but when Maximilien talks
I forget everything."
</p>

<p>
Then taking up her basket of salad, she called
Victoire to help her.  They used to dine out of
doors when the weather was fine; the table was
already there, and had only to be laid.  Ah! that
<i>fête</i>&mdash;how it turned everybody's head!  Mother
Duplay was certainly late, to her great discomfiture.
Yes, she was late&mdash;she, the pink of punctuality.
</p>

<p>
"And the chicken will be burnt to a cinder!"
</p>

<p>
She ran to the kitchen, on the ground floor, next
to the dining room, and found her youngest daughter,
Madame Lebas, already there.
</p>

<p>
"I thought of it, mamma!" she said.
</p>

<p>
The chicken, nicely cooked to a golden brown,
swimming in gravy, was ready to be served.
</p>

<p>
"Now then!  Let us make haste!" said Madame
Duplay, highly amused at being caught by her
daughter.  "Strain the soup while I prepare the
salad.  Oh, Victoire, we haven't laid the cloth yet!"
</p>

<p>
With the Duplays, it was a long-established
custom that everything connected with the kitchen
or the table should be entrusted only to the family;
the maid washed up when the meal was over.  Perhaps
this was an excess of prudence, or a fear of
poison.  Whatever the motive was, Robespierre
highly approved the practice.
</p>

<p>
"It is well to know what one is eating," he
would often say.
</p>

<p>
The two girls and Madame Lebas took it in
turns to wait at table, and so they could all speak
freely, without being restrained by the presence of
the servant.
</p>

<p>
The soup was now served up, steaming hot, and
Madame Lebas was ladling it out in equal portions,
reserving the last, as the hottest, for Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"To table!  To table!" she cried, placing
chairs for every one.
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre and Duplay did not move.
They were deeply interested in something Lebas
was telling them.  Duplay's son-in-law had just
returned from the Tuileries, where he had gone
"to feel the pulse of the Convention," as he
expressed it.  The National Assembly, although
undermined by some evil-minded members, would
be excellently represented at the <i>fête</i> on the
morrow.  The abominable rogues who had charged
Robespierre with intending to turn this popular
manifestation to his own profit had been
disappointed&mdash;an appropriate reward for their drivelling
calumny!  No one attached the slightest importance
to their scandalous reports.  The Convention,
as well as the people, were with Robespierre.  Only
the Committee of Public Safety...
</p>

<p>
"But, I say, children, the soup will be cold,"
Madame Duplay called out in desperation.
</p>

<p>
Simon the wooden-legged came down from his
room, declaring that he was famished.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are!  Here we are!" the three men
exclaimed, taking their seats.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had made a sign to Lebas to change
the conversation on account of the women.  Then
significantly shrugging his shoulders, he whispered
to him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The Committee of Public Safety?  Well, I
shall be ready for them!"
</p>

<p>
At table Robespierre, who was seated between
Monsieur and Madame Duplay, hardly tasted his
soup.
</p>

<p>
"The soup doesn't please you, friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes!  Very good!  Excellent!"
</p>

<p>
Victoire cleared away the soup plates as slowly as
possible, waiting for Robespierre.  When he had
finished, she said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That is right, <i>bon ami</i>.  You know you have to
keep up your strength for to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Madame Lebas now returned from the kitchen
with the capon, and was greeted by a general
murmur of admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!" cried Simon Duplay, who was a bit
of a gourmand.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow, children, you shall have duck, duck
and turnips!" said Madame Duplay, much gratified,
as she set to work to carve the fowl, giving
Robespierre the white meat, which he took mechanically,
deep in thought.  Lebas told them that he had seen
Fouquier-Tinville, the Public Prosecutor, who was
returning from the Bastille, where he had been to
inspect the new installation.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes! the guillotine!" interposed mother
Duplay, continuing to carve.  "But it didn't work
to-day, did it?"
</p>

<p>
"It will not work to-morrow either," said Robespierre,
"but the day after to-morrow ..."
</p>

<p>
"Will you allude to it in your discourse, <i>bon ami</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, towards the end; for it is well that the
aristocrats should know that we are not disarming."
</p>

<p>
"Decidedly," chimed in Duplay, "that would be
too stupid."
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, warmed by the tone of the conversation,
recovered his appetite.
</p>

<p>
"At all events," he said, "the <i>fête</i> to-morrow will
be a warning for every one; for the aristocrats, as
well as for many a Judas of the party."
</p>

<p>
He stopped to express his appreciation of the
fowl, sending up his plate for more.
</p>

<p>
"A leg, or a wing?" asked mother Duplay,
delighted.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre suddenly turned round.  He had
heard a noise.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure the front door has just been opened,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Simon Duplay took out a match to light a lamp,
and young Maurice rose, looking out into the
dark.
</p>

<p>
"It's true," he said; "it's a woman with a large
parcel."
</p>

<p>
"Our dresses, surely!" exclaimed Cornélie, who
had been somewhat morose and silent until then.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, our dresses," cried Madame Lebas and
Victoire expectantly.
</p>

<p>
It was, after all, only the dresses, which the
dressmaker had at last brought.  The enormous box was
handled by them eagerly; they wished to open it
there and then.  However, Victoire, prudently fearing
to soil the contents, carried it into the dining-room,
followed by her sisters.
</p>

<p>
The conversation was resumed with lively interest
by the light of the lamp just lit, and opinions were
freely expressed that as Royalty had her <i>fêtes</i>, the
world would now see what a Republican <i>fête</i> could
be like.  It would be truly national, imposing, and
symbolical.
</p>

<p>
The young women had not yet returned.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo! you children! what are you doing
there?" called out old Duplay.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are!  Here we are!" answered Victoire,
appearing that moment on the threshold of the
dining-room in a pretty white dress, coquettishly
pushing back her hair, disordered by her hasty toilet.
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't it suit me?" she said.  "Oh! don't
look at my hair; it isn't arranged," and she ran
down the steps followed by Madame Lebas and
Cornélie, also arrayed in their new finery.
</p>

<p>
Mother Duplay scolded her daughters.
</p>

<p>
"What!  You dressed yourselves in the dining-room?
Why, it is positively improper!  Isn't it,
Maximilien?"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Let them alone, <i>bonne mère</i>.  It's not <i>fête</i> every
day!"
</p>

<p>
And he looked at the dresses, pronouncing them
charming, and in perfect taste.
</p>

<p>
Madame Lebas was in blue, Victoire in white,
and Cornélie in red.
</p>

<p>
"The three colours!" observed the boy Maurice.
</p>

<p>
"We wanted to give you a surprise," said
Cornélie, advancing towards Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing could have given me more pleasure,"
he replied.  "That is what I call true patriotism."
</p>

<p>
The noise of hurrying feet, the sound of voices
and music, the hum of Paris in the distance
preparing for the coming <i>fête</i> centered through the open
window.  Fireworks burst in mid-air, then suddenly
seemed to radiate in a blaze of glory.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, look!" exclaimed the boy Maurice, as
showers of golden fire fell in a cascade of light.
Robespierre musingly watched their slow descent,
which to his overstrained imagination took the form
of one huge halo of glory.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was early up and dressed next morning,
and he was received by the Duplays in the
courtyard with cries of surprise, for it was scarcely
nine o'clock.  "What! dressed already!  And we
haven't commenced!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre told them he had hastened in order
to be at the Tuileries in time to superintend things
a bit, and to arrange matters with his friends, that
there might be no hitch.  People would talk so!
The slightest thing might mar the splendour of the
manifestation, which would be a pity on such a
splendid day!
</p>

<p>
"The sky is naturally propitious for the <i>fête</i> of
the Supreme Being," said Victoire; "but you will
have some breakfast, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I shall breakfast over there."
</p>

<p>
They now surrounded him, retaining him to
arrange the folds of his cravat, or brush grains of
powder from the revers of his coat, which they all
declared suited him to perfection.  He received the
compliment with visible pleasure, as he had given
himself no little trouble over his toilet for the
great occasion.
</p>

<p>
He wore a light blue coat, nankeen breeches
buttoned above the knees, where a stream of tri-colour
ribbons was attached.  White silk stockings
and buckled shoes completed the array of this real
Republican dandy.  He was powdered of course,
as usual, and had even indulged in an extra puff or
so, but his most extravagant conceit was displayed
in the lace waistcoat which spread like a filmy
foam across his breast.  The women went into
ecstasies over this, and declared his taste exquisite.
As he was taking leave, Cornélie appeared with
an enormous bouquet of wild flowers and ears of
corn in her hand.
</p>

<p>
"And the bouquet?" she asked, giving it to
him at the same time.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! yes!  I had forgotten it.  How kind you
are!  <i>Au revoir</i>.  I shall see you by and by,
looking your best, I am sure!"
</p>

<p>
And Robespierre, spick and span in his new
clothes, all curled and perfumed, picked his way
daintily across the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
At the door he found Lebas, Simon the wooden-legged,
and the boy Maurice Duplay awaiting him.
They wished to escort him to the Tuileries.
Didier, the agent, now came up, accompanied by
two of his men, and they all started in the direction
of the Rue Saint-Honoré, keeping to the right.
The Incorruptible conversed with Lebas.
</p>

<p>
A breeze stirred the flowers that decorated the
front of the houses, wafting abroad their perfume.
People were filling the streets from all directions,
all in festive attire, with palms and ears of corn
in their hands.  On recognising the Incorruptible,
they bowed to him; delighted, he discreetly returned
their salutations.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had turned into the Passage des
Feuillantes, and found himself on the terrace.
Here a surprise awaited him.  The garden was
already, at that early hour, three-quarters full,
looking like an immense sea with wave upon wave
of tricolour ribbons, plumes, and cockades.  He
continued his way along the Terrace des Feuillantes,
a smile on his lips, returning the greetings as he
went, and then joined the stream of people moving
towards the Tuileries, happy to lose himself in that
crowd flocking to his own apotheosis.
</p>

<p>
Flowers festooned the front of the Palace from
end to end, lending to it the freshness of spring-tide.
</p>

<p>
When Robespierre arrived he cast a hasty glance
at the vast amphitheatre which awaited the National
Convention.  It was still empty.  The amphitheatre
extended from the gardens to the balcony
of the Horloge, from which projected a tribune,
erected above the seats of the deputies&mdash;the tribune
of the President, his tribune.  It was from there
that he would speak to the people, assembled to
hear and to applaud him.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre entered the Palace alone, Lebas and
the two Duplays having gone back to the Rue
Saint-Honoré to fetch the family.  Beaming with
expectation, the Incorruptible looked about in search
of some familiar faces, but he found none.  He
crossed the Convention Chamber to the offices of
the Committee of Public Safety, and questioned the
men in charge, who told him that only the members
Barère, Collot d'Herbois, Prieur, and Carnot had
put in an appearance for a moment, and then had
gone to breakfast at a restaurant.  As he crossed
the Hall of Liberty he met Vilate, a fellow-juryman
of Duplay's on the Revolutionary Tribunal.  Vilate
was under an obligation to Robespierre, who, in
conjunction with Barère, had procured for him a
residence in the Palace at the Flora Pavilion.  It
was the surest way of having a spy ready at hand, a
reliable and silent witness of every act and move of
the Committee of Public Safety.  Vilate, at once
insinuating and deferential, invited him to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"It would be so convenient," he suggested, for
he could breakfast, and yet not lose the splendid
spectacle of the crowd as seen from the first story.
Robespierre accepted the invitation, and remained
for two hours there.  Even after Vilate had left
him he stayed on, looking down on all the preparations,
lost in a day-dream of anticipated joy.  He
was nearing the supreme moment, the popular
moment, which would raise him so high above his
colleagues that henceforth any steps taken against
him would be considered as directed against the
nation itself.  He smiled.  His dictatorship?  Was
it not imposed on him by the French people?
Was it not the outcome of the public will?  It
would be presently called for by a hundred thousand
voices in these very gardens, in presence of all
France, represented by the three hundred deputies
of the Convention.  He remained in meditation,
smiling still, his forehead pressed against a pane
of the window, his looks plunged in that living
sea swaying at his feet.  If ever Robespierre was
happy, it was at this supreme moment.
</p>

<p>
Some one knocked.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" he said, as if awakened from a dream.
</p>

<p>
It was Lebas, who, all out of breath, came to tell
him that the Convention was assembled, and only
awaited his arrival.
</p>

<p>
"Vilate sent me here.  I was wondering where
to find you."
</p>

<p>
Robespierre looked up in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"It can't be very late," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it is half-past twelve!"
</p>

<p>
"Half-past twelve?"
</p>

<p>
The <i>fête</i> had been fixed for noon.  He was then
half an hour behind time!  And the ironical smiles
of some of his colleagues when he appeared in the
tribune were not the least bitter consequences of his
unpunctuality.
</p>

<p>
A voice was heard saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He has at last decided to put in an appearance!"
</p>

<p>
And then another&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't even the courtesy of kings, yet he
has enough of their insolence!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre recognised the voice.
</p>

<p>
It was Barère's.  Drops of gall were already
falling into his cup of joy.  But as the people began
to applaud at the lower end of the gardens,
Robespierre advanced to the edge of the tribune, and
bowed.  The expectant crowd swayed as one man
towards him, unwilling to lose a single gesture or a
single word.  So stood the Incorruptible, enwrapped
and penetrated by the inebriating vapours of adulation
and the perfume of all the palms and bouquets
that rose as incense at his feet.
</p>

<p>
But again a discordant note was touched, and
another voice was heard&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"See how like a throne the tribune stands!"
</p>

<p>
And in fact, set high above the steps, it did seem
raised on a pedestal.  Robespierre felt this as in
some embarrassment he unfolded his manuscript,
and commenced.  His voice was almost inaudible,
except to the members of the Convention seated
near him.  Passages on which he counted most
passed unheeded, and he felt the encouragement
of his friends to be indiscriminate and misplaced,
like that of some theatre claque.
</p>

<p>
When he had finished he was greeted with
considerable applause, that was more formal than
genuine; it mounted from the gardens and reached
him, mingled with the strains of Gossec's hymn,
just started by the Opera choir.  Robespierre left
the tribune dissatisfied with himself, but convinced
that his address to the people on the Place de la
Révolution, from the altar of flowers erected at the
foot of the statue of Liberty, would retrieve this first
failure.  There he would be in direct contact with
people, and then they would see!  For he felt the
people were with him; their acclamation coming up
to him from the gardens was proof enough.
</p>

<p>
He descended the steps, followed by the Convention,
and went towards the first fountain on the
lawn, from which rose an allegorical group,
representing Atheism surrounded by the Vices, led by
Folly, while Wisdom, standing apart, pointed a
warning finger at the group.  He was to set a
match to this ingenious specimen of artistic
pyrotechny, when Atheism was supposed to
disappear, dragged down by Folly and the Vices,
leaving Wisdom alone, radiantly triumphant.  But it
was the very opposite that happened.  Wisdom
caught fire and upset the whole arrangement,
provoking disrespectful laughter among the deputies.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre turned pale.  The <i>fête</i> had certainly
not opened auspiciously.  Then, in spite of himself,
an instinctive and uncontrollable desire to lean on
some one, which always took possession of him in
hours of suffering, mastered him.  As he looked
round in search of a sympathising glance, his eyes
fell on a fair, rosy child, in its young mother's arms,
trying to play with bouquets of corn and wild flowers
which its mother kept from him.  Robespierre
recognised the bouquet which in his excitement he
had left on the tribune, and which the young woman
now held out to him.  This delicate attention fell
on his parched soul like refreshing dew, and he
gratefully accepted the simple homage offered with
such charming frankness.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre now headed the procession, preceded
by trumpets and drums, followed by the Convention
through the line of National Guards, who kept back
the curious crowd on either side of the garden, as
the line wound its way towards the swing-bridge
which opened on to the Place de la Révolution.
</p>

<p>
The deputies were all there, dressed in official
garb: dark blue coat, red collar and cuffs,
tight-fitting knee breeches of doeskin, high boots, broad
tricolour sashes across the breast, fastened on the
left shoulder, and tricolour plumes in their hats.
Each member carried in his hand a bouquet of
flowers and ears of corn.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was conspicuous by the difference in
his attire, which was of a lighter blue.  He walked
well ahead of his colleagues, as if to accentuate the
distance between himself and them in the eyes of the
crowd, who, with keen curiosity, were climbing on
stools, on ladders, on the bases of statues, on gates,
and even on the trees, to get a better view of him.
Thus Robespierre, whose serenity had now returned,
advanced towards the Place de la Révolution, where
he knew that the greater mass of the people were
assembled to receive him with thunders of applause.
</p>

<p>
The sound of "<i>Vivat!  Vivat!</i>" was heard in
the distance, accompanied by the roll of the
Champ-de-Mars cannon, which fired a resounding salute at
regular intervals.  Those vivas were welcoming on
the Place de la Révolution the <i>cortège</i> which had
preceded Robespierre and the members of the
Convention; the delegates from the different sections of
Paris, who entered amidst the beat of drums and
blare of brass instruments, headed by a standard-bearer.
The procession had no sooner reached the
square than they parted into two lines; on one side
women and young girls, dressed in white and
crowned with roses; on the other, old men and
youths, carrying branches of oak and laurel.  The
crowd, kept back by a rope of tricolour ribbons,
received the procession with enthusiastic shouts,
chanting with the choirs the choruses of the <i>Chant
du Départ</i>.  To the passionate strains of Mehul's
national anthem succeeded soon after a hymn
appropriate to the occasion, Gossec's composition
calling down the benediction of the Supreme Being on
France and on humanity.
</p>

<p>
The people applauded, but stopped directly to
welcome another group of the Paris section, a
company of young Republican warriors dressed in blue
and rose-colour, holding aloft lances decked with
tricolour ribbons.  The greatest triumph of all,
however, was the group symbolising the Four
Ages&mdash;Childhood, Youth, Manhood, and Old
Age&mdash;represented by a multitude of children, youths,
maidens, men and women, both middle-aged and old,
some crowned with violets, others with myrtle,
oak-leaves, olive-branches, and vine-leaves.  One
unanimous cry of admiration rose from the crowd and
resounded through the immense square, where the
sun fell in burning rays on the silks, velvets,
and brocades, playing in the gold fringe of flags and
banners, and on the many tricolour ribbons and
streamers, in a flood of dazzling light.
</p>

<p>
The excitement of the populace was now at its
height, and, as the members of the Convention
appeared in sight, a cry rose suddenly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He is here!"
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Robespierre."
</p>

<p>
A tremor of curiosity ran through the crowd who,
mad with excitement, poured forth their welcome in
a storm of enthusiastic cheers and plaudits, even
before their hero came in sight.  A sheriff, then a
delegate, then a master of ceremonies, were by turns
loudly cheered by the eager multitude, who in their
impatience had taken them for the Incorruptible.
At last he passed, smiling affably, hat in his hand,
and the cry ran from mouth to mouth&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is he!  It is he!"
</p>

<p>
This time it was really Robespierre; there was
no mistake.  Hats, caps, handkerchiefs, waved on
all sides; women raised sprays of loses in the air
and men branches of palm.
</p>

<p>
This outburst threatened to break up the <i>cortège</i>
of the Four Ages, which, like the preceding one, had
ranged itself round the statute of Liberty, where
Robespierre was to deliver his discourse.  Children
begged their mothers to lift them up, that they might
see also.  At the same moment the solemn chords
of a harp floated on the air.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre advanced slowly, slackening his pace,
for he had become suddenly aware of the great
distance which separated him from the deputies, who
filed into the square six abreast, grave and slow, like
judges.  The different groups of the procession, who
had arranged themselves in regular lines, now
unveiled the statute of Liberty, where an altar of
flowers and foliage had been erected.  It was at
this altar that Robespierre was to officiate, and
consecrate amidst the burning of incense the worship
of the Supreme Being.
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible was now passing the very spot
where on the previous day the scaffold still stood.  A
woman in the crowd called attention to this in all
simplicity.  But her voice was quickly drowned by
a hundred harps, whose dulcet music filled the air.
All members of the Convention had reached the
Place de la Révolution, when a new <i>cortège</i> came in
sight, the chariot of Agriculture, draped in blue,
covered with garlands of roses, and drawn by a yoke
of oxen with gilded horns.  The goddess of
Agriculture was impersonated by a beautiful girl from
the Opera, who smiled on the crowd with her light
blue eyes, looking the very incarnation of luxuriant
youth, her blonde beauty framed in ripe golden corn
and fruits of the rich harvest.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, now standing before the altar, was
burning incense in a golden tripod, amidst the mute
reverence of the crowd, who behaved as if assisting
at some religious ceremony.  Presently, descending
the steps of the altar, he turned to address the
multitude.
</p>

<p>
All music had ceased, each voice was silenced,
every whisper hushed; even the cries of pedlars and
street-hawkers were unheard.  A hundred thousand
eyes were fixed on Robespierre, who, set up on high
and wrapped in clouds of incense, appeared to tower
in stature, to dominate that mass of human beings
with all the force of a prevailing pride.
</p>

<p>
A sudden inspiration seized him: he would repeat
the more notable phrases of his former discourse,
here, to that crowd whose mighty heart he felt
beating with his own; he would have his revenge, and
hear his burning words applauded by the nation
itself!  Ah! had the deputies been indifferent, cold,
hesitating in their applause?  Well, they should
receive a lesson that would be at once a warning
and a mandate!  The delegates of the nation
should be censured publicly by the very nation they
represented!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had delivered the opening sentences
of his speech.  Carried away by the enthusiastic
ovation of the crowd, now entirely master of
himself and of his discourse, his words flowed freely
and abundantly, and he declaimed without once
referring to his notes, in a clear, penetrating voice.
Every point was greeted with a thunder of applause
as he spoke on, stimulated by a glow of satisfaction
which touched the most secret fibres of his being.
He felt himself to be for ever and in very deed
master of France, acclaimed Dictator, solely by the
people's will.  Through the fumes of this mad
delirium he saw the Convention vanquished,
paralysed with fear and amazement.
</p>

<p>
He was thanking the French nation, who had
laid aside their work to lift their thoughts and
aspirations towards the Great, the Supreme Being.
</p>

<p>
"Never," exclaimed the Incorruptible, "never
has this world which He created offered Him a
sight more worthy of His regard.  He has seen
the reign of tyranny, crime, and imposture on the
earth&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But a stir was noticeable in the crowd, not far
from Robespierre.  A man had just made an
observation in an audible whisper, attracting the
attention of the bystanders.  They looked at him
in surprise, trying to divine his meaning, but
Robespierre, who was too far off to have heard,
continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Frenchmen! if you would triumph over your
enemies, be just, give to the Divine Being the
only offerings worthy of Him&mdash;virtue, compassion,
forbearance&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"With the guillotine!" called the voice in the
crowd, with a bitter laugh.
</p>

<p>
A murmur rose round the man, every one
whispering out of respect for Robespierre, who
continued his harangue.  They questioned the man,
threatened him.  Voices grew louder.  "Silence!"
called the officials, but the disturbance went on.
"He ought to be arrested!" and the words drunkard,
aristocrat, <i>chouan</i>, were thrown at him.  "What
did he want?  What did he say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, what did you say?" asked a patriot
coming close to him.
</p>

<p>
"I say only what you ought all to cry out to
that charlatan&mdash;'Instead of burning incense to
your idol, Tyrant, burn the guillotine!'"
</p>

<p>
This daring critic, as the reader will guess at
once, was Olivier.
</p>

<p>
His voice was drowned in a burst of applause
which greeted the words of Robespierre encouraging
him to go on with his speech.
</p>

<p>
In presence of such irony Olivier lost all self-control.
</p>

<p>
"And they can applaud him, the fools!  They
can applaud him!"
</p>

<p>
The fury of the multitude, now unchained, knew
no bounds.  Cries of "To death with him!  To
death!" were heard amidst the awful tumult,
which completely drowned the voice of Robespierre,
whose anxiety was now also aroused.  Olivier,
down-trodden, his clothes torn to tatters, fought
and struggled in the grasp of twenty or more of
the infuriated populace.  "He must be killed!
He is an aristocrat!  A <i>chouan</i>!  To death with
him!"  One of the patriots lifted a be-ribboned
spike in the air, threatening to pierce his eyes.
But a man armed to the teeth, dagger and pistols
in his belt, pushed aside the crowd and seized the
offender by the throat.  He then turned and bade
them make way for the officers of the peace who
followed him.
</p>

<p>
"Stand back there!" he cried.  "This man is
to be dealt with by justice only!"
</p>

<p>
It was Héron, chief police-agent of the Committee
of Public Safety.
</p>

<p>
With the assistance of his men Héron dragged
the offender to the feet of Robespierre, who,
being informed of the affair, had asked to see the
interrupter.
</p>

<p>
But a vociferating crowd obstructed the passage.
Robespierre impatiently descended the steps of the
altar.  The whole Convention and the <i>cortège</i> had
moved also, wishing to see.  The police forced
a way in the crowd for Robespierre.  At the name
of the Incorruptible the multitude gave way, and
Olivier appeared before him, struggling in the
powerful grasp of Héron.
</p>

<p>
"Against whom does this madman, who disturbs
our <i>fête</i>, bear a grudge?" asked Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"Against you! hypocrite and scoundrel!" Olivier
cried; "against you, who dare speak of justice
and humanity on this spot soaked with the blood
you have spilled!"
</p>

<p>
A horrified scream rose from the crowd, but was
as soon hushed at a sign from Robespierre.  Olivier
tried to throw himself on him, but was held back
by the police.
</p>

<p>
"Look at the soles of your shoes, you butcher!"
he cried desperately.  "They are red with
blood!"
</p>

<p>
He was not allowed to continue.
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible motioned the agents to remove
him out of reach of the furious and exasperated
crowd, who continued to cry out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"To death with him!  To death!"
</p>

<p>
Olivier turned in the grasp of his gaolers and
cried&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You can kill me, murder me, ruffians!  but I
have cried out, as others will cry out after me,
'Down with the scaffold!'"
</p>

<p>
His words were lost in the tumult.  Robespierre
reascended the steps of the statue, and tried to
calm the people.
</p>

<p>
"Citizens!" he said, "let us give ourselves up
to the joys of this <i>fête</i>, which the insults and
outrages of a rebel shall not disturb!  To-morrow the
sword of Justice will strike with renewed ardour
the enemies of our country!"
</p>

<p>
Loud plaudits followed, and cries of "Long live
the Republic!  Long live Robespierre!  Long live
the Incorruptible!"
</p>

<p>
"Down with the scaffold!" cried a faint voice
in the distance.
</p>

<p>
It was Olivier, whom the police, aided by the
National Guards, were carrying away in chains.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
AN EVENING AT THE DUPLAYS'
</h3>

<p>
Robespierre slowly descended the altar steps
with a preoccupied air, for that last desperate cry of
Olivier had struck its mark.  However self-possessed
he might be, he had felt the blow acutely.
That voice, full of hatred and revenge, had risen
from the crowd he thought entirely at one with
him!  In their very applause at that moment the
people were protesting against an insult coming
from their ranks!  They were driven to defend him,
when he had dreamt that the populace would receive
him with instant and unanimous enthusiasm, insuring
to him for ever the esteem of France!
</p>

<p>
Pale and anxious, he followed the procession to
the Champ de Mars, where the <i>fête</i> was to close
with one crowning patriotic demonstration.  He
felt that his supremacy was tottering, and wondered
how many more discordant notes would disturb the
prevailing harmony.  Alas! there were already
signs of jarring discord.  Certain members of the
Convention talked aloud in a free, sarcastic strain,
on the road, openly exchanging opinions, emboldened
by Olivier's public insult.  Words of dark and
ominous import reached the ears of
Robespierre&mdash;words of hatred and scorn, of tragic foreboding, and
portentous prophecy.  "I despise and hate him!"
said one.  "There is but one step from the
Tarpeian Rock to the Capitol!" said another.  And a
third added: "A Brutus may yet arise!"  To
close the mouths of these backbiters, he mentally
reflected, and to save all, nothing was wanted but
the <i>vox populi</i>, the supreme and national mandate,
uprising from the assembled multitude and re-echoed
through the whole of France: "Robespierre Dictator!
Dictator for life!"  But the Incorruptible
awaited any such acclaim in vain.
</p>

<p>
The <i>fête</i> of the Champ de Mars which followed
was wanting in the brilliancy and magnificence of
the preceding festival.  Every one was hot and
unstrung.  Robespierre again addressed the people,
who, tired from having stood so long under a
burning sun, were listless and absent-minded.  The
demonstration was drawing to its close amidst a
general feeling of depression.
</p>

<p>
Nothing but confusion reigned on the march
homeward.  Robespierre was to return to the Tuileries
to meet several of his colleagues, but instead,
he hurried away, fully resolved to shut himself up in
his room and open his door to no one, not even to
the Duplays, who had dogged his steps the whole
way back, trying to catch him up, and only succeeding
at the threshold of their house, where Robespierre
begged them to have their little festive party
without him.
</p>

<p>
"I want rest," he said.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>fête</i> went very well, didn't it?" asked
mother Duplay.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, very well!" replied Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"Then you are satisfied?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly!"
</p>

<p>
As Cornélie began to tell him of some details
which she thought had escaped him, he put her off
gently, saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Was it so?  Indeed!  Well, you will tell me that
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"What!  You will not dine with us?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I must ask to be excused."
</p>

<p>
And as she pressed him to join them, he
repeated&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No, no; I must beg you to excuse me!  <i>Au
revoir</i> till to-morrow!  <i>Au revoir!</i>"
</p>

<p>
With these words he went up to his room and
locked himself in.
</p>

<p>
Every one was in low spirits at the Duplays' that
evening.  They scarcely tasted their supper.  No
one was deceived by Robespierre's feigned indisposition;
they were well aware that the <i>fête</i> had been
a great disappointment to him, and they shared his
chagrin, though they determined that this should be
in no way apparent.
</p>

<p>
"We must not disturb his meditations," observed
mother Duplay.
</p>

<p>
"But are we not going to see the fireworks?"
asked the boy Maurice anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"We are not," declared mother Duplay.  "How
could we enjoy ourselves without him?"
</p>

<p>
And they went early to bed.
</p>

<p>
The house, which had awakened to joy, now
slumbered silently whilst Paris was being lit up to
prepare for the populace, again in holiday mood,
the promised display of fireworks.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre rejoined the Duplays next day at
supper.  He had spent the morning and afternoon
locked in his room, under pretext of working.
And work he did.  Alone, in sullen silence, he
prepared that atrocious Prairial law, which he intended
to lay before Convention forthwith&mdash;a law which
aimed at nothing less than the entire suppression of
the right of defence before the Revolutionary
Tribunal.  Moral evidence was to suffice;
cross-examinations, depositions, and the testimony of
witnesses were to be done away with.  To be a
"suspect" would itself be a proof of guilt.
</p>

<p>
Ah! he had been insulted!  Well, this was his
reply to the insult.  He had wished to establish his
dictatorship under conditions of peace, but the great
pacific demonstration had not availed him.  Were
these cowards only to be subjugated by terror?
They should have it then, with renewed vigour, in
a whirlwind of tempestuous violence carrying
everything before it.  It should be a fearful and
memorable lesson!  Every trace of those stubborn,
headstrong rebels should be swept away by the stroke
of its formidable wing!
</p>

<p>
This law, drafted entirely by him, with its every
villainy cunningly concealed, or placed in the light
of a sacred duty, and as the only means of assuring
public safety, Robespierre would himself lay before
the Convention.  The deputies, who had been
insulted in the person of their President by that
brawling meddler arrested on the Place de la Révolution,
could not but pass the law, after such a scandalous
scene.  That public insult of the riotous rebel was
an excellent pretext.  It would help him to take
them by surprise, to wring from them the vote which
would place entirely at his mercy not only his rivals
who had expressed their opinions so freely, but also
that rude scoffer, already doomed to die.
</p>

<p>
His trial would not last long!  But before his
death he should be brought before Robespierre.  He
should lay bare the most secret recesses of his soul,
denounce his accomplices, and disclose his connections
and parentage.  Such an insult, the cruellest
Robespierre had as yet sustained, demanded an
exemplary penalty.  The death of the man himself
would not suffice; he should pay with the heads of
every one connected with him in any way&mdash;accomplices,
friends, and relations.  Ah! the wretch, he
had sacrificed not only his own life, but the lives of
all near and dear to him!
</p>

<p>
Pondering still on the cross-examination he would
so soon be able to enforce, Robespierre descended
into the dining-room, where the family had assembled
for supper.  The table had not been laid
out-of-doors, partly on account of the uncertain weather,
but more especially to divert Robespierre's attention,
by a change of surroundings, from the remembrance
of the last two days, and to turn into a fresh
channel the secret thoughts of their good friend, which
they felt still dwelt on the failure of his inauguration.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre found the family so bright and affable
that his reappearance was not embarrassing.  He
had but to explain vaguely the cause of his
indisposition, which was quite gone.  Oh, yes! every one
could see that!  Why, he looked so well, so full of
life!  What a good thing it was, after all, to have
had a day's rest!
</p>

<p>
But this conspiracy of smiles, which had put him at
his ease so quickly, soon began to irritate him.  The
whole family racked their brains to find scraps of
news and items of interest outside the one all-absorbing
subject of his thoughts.  When the dessert came
on, however, Robespierre himself turned the conversation
to the carefully avoided theme, and asked their
candid opinion of the previous day's <i>fête</i>.
</p>

<p>
As they resorted to evasions, giving a host of
details to escape the main question, he asked them
plainly what they thought of his personal success.
</p>

<p>
"It was gigantic!" said Madame Duplay.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that's a woman's answer&mdash;a mother's!"
he replied sadly.
</p>

<p>
And longing for sympathy, he opened his heart to
them; he had been disappointed in his dearest hopes;
everything must begin over again.  Lebas interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"You exaggerate, I think."
</p>

<p>
Robespierre replied calmly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am so far from exaggerating that I have passed
the whole day in preparing my revenge."
</p>

<p>
Here they were interrupted by a knock at the
door, and young Duplay rose to open it.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! it is Buonarotti!" they all exclaimed.
"What a pleasant surprise!"
</p>

<p>
But it was not a surprise at all.  The demoiselles
Duplay had invited Buonarotti to supper, a
valuable and ever-welcome guest, in so far that he
played the harpsichord to perfection, and used to
accompany Lebas, who was always ready to show his
talent on the violin.  Buonarotti was an original
character, a Corsican by birth, claiming descent from
Michaël-Angelo.  He was an ardent revolutionist,
and an enthusiastic admirer of Robespierre.  He had
begged to be excused from accepting the invitation
to dinner, but promised to come in afterwards to
cheer up his friend.
</p>

<p>
The family took advantage of his entrance to
leave the table and move to the drawing-room, where
music was soon started, in spite of the terrible
longing Buonarotti had to talk politics, and to give
Robespierre an account of the different opinions of
the <i>fête</i> which he had picked up here and there.
But they had dragged him coaxingly to the harpsichord,
laying a sonata of Mozart before him, of
which Lebas had already struck the first bars on his
violin.
</p>

<p>
In no other apartment was the hero-worship of
the Duplays more evident than in this drawing-room,
with its furniture covered in Utrecht velvet, where
portraits of the Incorruptible faced each other in
every conceivable form and position&mdash;on the walls,
on the tables, on the brackets, and even on the
harpsichord; in crayon, water-colours, plaster-cast
medallions, bronze, and terra-cotta.  This was the
sanctuary in which the Duplays loved to congregate
under the auspices of their demigod.  It was here
they spent their evenings, when sometimes a few
friends were admitted to the intimacy of the family
circle.  The young women, seated at the round
table, would occupy themselves with sewing or
embroidery, whilst the men conversed on one subject
or another, more often suggested by some letters or
reports among Robespierre's correspondence, which
was usually sorted by Lebas or Duplay.
</p>

<p>
The hours were sometimes enlivened by music,
and sometimes also by recitation.  When there was
music Lebas and Buonarotti carried off all the
honours, but in recitation it was Robespierre who
triumphed, for he had preserved from his youth the
love of rhymed and sonorous phrases.  As he had
read aloud to himself long ago in his little room at
the Hôtel de Pontivy the burning pages of "La
Nouvelle Héloïse," so he read now, amidst these
austere Republican surroundings, the tragedies of
Corneille and of Racine, giving himself up to the
magic sway of the rhythmic verse, a smile of
appreciation on his lips.
</p>

<p>
But that evening he was quite preoccupied, and
gave but little attention to the music, as he sat with
his back to the mantelpiece, entirely absorbed in the
voluminous correspondence which had just reached
him&mdash;letters, reports, denunciations and the like.
He sorted them feverishly, handing them one by
one to Simon the wooden-legged, who stood near
him, either to classify them or to throw them in
the waste-paper basket.  Mother Duplay, ensconced
in a deep armchair, was indulging in her after-dinner
nap, whilst old Duplay smoked his pipe, leaning on
the window ledge to watch the departure of some of the
workmen kept late over some pressing work.  Young
Maurice Duplay ran backwards and forwards from one
group to another, as lively and active as a squirrel.
</p>

<p>
Buonarotti, still at the harpsichord, was now
playing the hymn to the Supreme Being, by Gossec.
The air fell on Robespierre's ears and brought back
the previous day's <i>fête</i> to his memory: the procession
from the gardens of the Tuileries; the affectation
of the deputies in keeping so far behind him to
make it appear that he had already assumed the role
of Dictator; the whole plot which he felt was
undermining the popular rejoicings; and the untoward
scene of that final insult.  All this and more was
suggested by that hymn composed to celebrate his
apotheosis, but reminding him to-day of his defeat.
His defeat! yes, nothing less than defeat!  These
anonymous letters, inspired by hatred and envy,
proved it only too plainly, and it was emphasised by
the reports of his police agents, in whose obsequious
language a certain embarrassment could be detected.
</p>

<p>
Just then Didier, the chief agent, entered, bringing
the latest news, and when Robespierre asked him
his impression of the <i>fête</i>, he declared it to have been
perfect.
</p>

<p>
"You are lying!" said Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
Brought to bay by the Incorruptible's questions,
the police agent owned the truth.  The affair bad
been a disastrous failure.  It was the fault of the
organisers, of Didier's own scouts.  Every one, in
fact, was to blame.  The men hired to applaud had
been imprudently paid in advance.  They had drunk
hard, lingered in the taverns, and only arrived on
the scene when the <i>fête</i> was already compromised.
Didier gave him other details, corroborating the
reports which had just reached him, and opened his
eyes to things ignored before.  Robespierre was
dumfounded on hearing of the audacious conduct
of his enemies.  He called Duplay, who was still at
the window, to seek counsel with him.  But Didier,
emboldened by the interest which the Incorruptible
took in his disclosures, ventured himself to proffer
advice.
</p>

<p>
"Between ourselves," he said, "the guillotine is
becoming unpopular."
</p>

<p>
And he confessed that the young fanatic's cry of
"Down with the scaffold!" at the <i>fête</i>, seemed to
have been trembling on the lips of a considerable
number of the spectators, who were more than half
inclined to protect the insulter from the violence of
the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"They are heartily sick of it," he continued.
"Another proof of this is the protest the inhabitants
near the Bastille have been making against its
erection there.  The Committee of Public Safety had to
see into the affair to-day in your absence, and have
decided that the guillotine should be transported to
the Barrière du Trône."
</p>

<p>
This last piece of news exasperated Robespierre
beyond measure.  What!  His colleagues of the
Committee dared to take such an important step in
his absence?  And that, too, the very day after he
had been publicly insulted!  In truth, the moment
was well chosen to show themselves ashamed of the
scaffold!  And as Robespierre questioned Duplay
on the number of prisoners condemned during the
day, he was astonished to learn that there were only
fifteen.  Had the Tribunal then been won over by
the Conspiracy of the Lenient?  However, the
carpenter assured him that it was simply a
coincidence, for he had heard Fouquier-Tinville, the
Public Prosecutor, remark at the conclusion of the
sitting that if things continued at this rate there
would never be an end of it.  There were, it
appeared, at that moment seven thousand prisoners
under lock and key.
</p>

<p>
"Fouquier-Tinville is right," said Robespierre;
"things move too slowly."
</p>

<p>
"But how can they go quicker?" asked Duplay,
who regarded his juryman's duties as sacred.
</p>

<p>
"Have patience!  I have my plans."
</p>

<p>
"May we hear them?"
</p>

<p>
"You shall know to-morrow.  I must first of
all make an example of that young fanatic, with
whom it is time to deal."
</p>

<p>
And turning to Didier he asked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"A few steps from here, at the police station of
the Rue Saint-Florentin, where Héron has locked
him up, pending your orders."
</p>

<p>
"Very well!  Bid Héron bring him here; I
wish to examine him instantly."
</p>

<p>
The peremptory tone admitted no reply.  Didier,
wishing the company good-night, left the room with
Simon Duplay, whom the Incorruptible had charged
with several messages, and Cornélie, taking advantage
of their departure, called Robespierre to the
harpsichord.
</p>

<p>
"And now, I hope you will take a little notice
of us," she said, coming towards him in half
petulant, half coquettish mood.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, softening at her approach, kissed her
hand.  Only let him have the time to answer a
letter from his friend Saint-Just, and he would be
entirely at her disposal.  And he seated himself at
the round table to write.  Only Buonarotti played
now.  Lebas had laid down his violin, and whilst
filling his pipe asked Robespierre for news of the
Army of the North, where Saint-Just then was.
All was going well there.  Robespierre had also
good news from his brother Augustin, then at Lyons,
and on the point of returning.  Augustin warmly
recommended to him a young general of the artillery
whom he had known at Nice, and who had already
distinguished himself at Toulon.
</p>

<p>
"Augustin tells me that this young man could
replace, to some advantage, that drunkard Hauriot
as commander of the armed force of Paris."
</p>

<p>
Buonarotti, who was still at the harpischord,
turned at the mention of Toulon.
</p>

<p>
"Bonaparte?" he said.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre looked across.  He knew him, then?
</p>

<p>
Yes, he knew him.  They had lived together in
Corsica.  And as the Incorruptible asked what
were the sentiments of the young soldier, he
replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Excellent.  He is Republican to the core."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we shall see," said Robespierre, favourably
inclined to a change, adverse as he was to the
idea of a military commander remaining too long in
the same post.
</p>

<p>
And he began his letter to Saint-Just, at the same
time lending an ear to Lebas, who was telling
Duplay of certain rumours coming from the army of
the aspiration of some of its chiefs to the
dictatorship.  But Duplay interrupted him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sapristi</i>!  I had almost forgotten!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre raised his eyes inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"I have a letter also to give you."
</p>

<p>
"From whom?" asked the Incorruptible, reassured
as soon as he knew it was only a letter.
</p>

<p>
"From a prisoner, I think, who very innocently
confided it to one of our spies.  It was given to me
just now at the Tribunal."
</p>

<p>
Duplay searched in his pockets, and having found
the letter, handed it to Robespierre, who continued
writing.
</p>

<p>
"Look at it with Lebas," he said.
</p>

<p>
Lebas took the letter, and going to the mantel-piece,
commenced to read it by the light of a candle.
Duplay, in the act of filling his pipe, looked over
his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
It was Clarisse's letter to Robespierre, and read
thus&mdash;
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"I should not write to you if I had only my own
life to plead for.  But I have to protect that of two
children, my niece imprisoned here with me and a
son of nineteen years, who may be arrested at any
moment and sent to the scaffold, and good God,
by whom!  CLARISSE."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had now finished his letter to
Saint-Just, and whilst closing it, asked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well, and the letter?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a woman who supplicates you for her
niece imprisoned with her," answered Lebas.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, annoyed, stopped him, saying curtly
that he received twenty such letters every day.
</p>

<p>
"She also supplicates you for her son," added
Lebas, still perusing the note.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre simply shrugged his shoulders and
sealed his letter to Saint-Just.
</p>

<p>
"Always the same refrain!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I throw it in the basket, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do, for goodness' sake!"
</p>

<p>
But Duplay took the letter from Lebas's hands,
twisted it into a spill, and ignited it at the candle to
light his pipe.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre now rose and went towards the
harpsichord, where he was received with joyous
exclamations.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are at last!"
</p>

<p>
Cornélie whispered a few words to Buonarotti,
and placed a new piece of music before him.
</p>

<p>
"As a reward," she said, "Buonarotti will sing
you one of his latest compositions."
</p>

<p>
"And the words are by a friend of yours," added
Madame Lebas, with a mysterious air.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, puzzled, asked the name of this
friend, but Victoire wished him to guess, and when
he demurred a battle of words ensued, in which his
stronger will prevailed.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then!  We will tell you the poet's name."
</p>

<p>
And as he was all attention, they exclaimed in
chorus&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Maximilian Robespierre!"
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible smiled.  What were they
talking about?  He the author of a poem!
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Before he had time to protest, Cornélie recited
the first verse&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Crois-moi, jeune et belle Ophélie...</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Ah, yes!  They were right.  Robespierre
remembered the piece now.  He had composed it
at Arras, and read it in public before the Society
of the Rosati, of which he was a member.  He
went on with the verse from memory, while
Cornélie followed in the book&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Si flatteur que soit ton miroir,<br>
  Sois charmante avec modestie,<br>
  Fais semblant de n'en rien savoir.</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
What! had Buonarotti really set that to music?
Robespierre was very curious to hear it.
</p>

<p>
"With pleasure!" said the Corsican.
</p>

<p>
Madame Lebas, seated at the piano, struck the
first chord of the accompaniment, and Buonarotti
commenced the song.  Every one had gathered
round the singer.
</p>

<p>
The first verse was greeted with loud applause.
</p>

<p>
Ah, how pretty it was!  How well the music
chimed in with the words!  What simplicity!
What grace!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, delighted, joined in the chorus of
praise, congratulating Buonarotti.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly every one stopped.  An ominous cry
came through the open window&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Buy to-day's list of the condemned."
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of newsvendors calling out the
result of the day's sitting at the Revolutionary
Tribunal.  The Incorruptible showed signs of
uneasiness.  Buonarotti had already begun the second
verse&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Sur le pouvair de tes appas<br>
  Demeure toujours alarmée...</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But a new cry was heard&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Winning numbers! ... Lottery of
Sainte-Guillotine!  Buy!  Buy!"
</p>

<p>
"Shut that window!" Robespierre called out
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
The boy Maurice ran to do so.
</p>

<p>
"Why!" he exclaimed, "here is Héron, and
three people with him."
</p>

<p>
At Héron's name Robespierre turned round
sharply, and as every one seemed surprised at the
untimely visit, he explained&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's all right!  I expected him.  He is
bringing the young villain of yesterday's <i>fête</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Ah yes," said the women, "the <i>chouan</i> of the
Place de la Concorde!" and they looked curiously
towards the door, at which the new-comers were
now knocking.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" cried Duplay.
</p>

<p>
Héron entered and bowed to every one in the
room.
</p>

<p>
"Is the culprit with you?" asked Robespierre
nervously.
</p>

<p>
The police-agent replied in the affirmative, and
was ordered to introduce the prisoner.  Héron
turned and signed to two men, who appeared
escorting Olivier, pale and dejected, his hands tied
behind his back.  The young man, no longer resisting,
seemed already to offer himself as a victim.
</p>

<p>
"He is a nice-looking fellow," observed Madame
Lebas, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
Héron pushed Olivier forward, who, perfectly
indifferent to his impending cross-examination, stood
sullenly aside.  Robespierre, always mistrustful,
made a rapid survey of the young man from head
to foot, keeping, however, at a safe distance from
the fettered prisoner.
</p>

<p>
"What have you learnt about him?" he asked
Héron.
</p>

<p>
The agent did not know much.  The day before,
while under arrest, the prisoner had let fall some
words by which Héron understood that his mother,
arrested with a young girl he loved, was threatened
with the scaffold.  But since his imprisonment he
had been completely mute.  No one had been able
to draw a word from him, and things would have
very likely remained thus had not Madame Beaugrand,
a lodging-house keeper of the Rue du Rocher,
come to the police-station for the purpose of
obtaining some particulars of the arrest, the news of
which had reached her.  From the description of
the young man she fancied he might be one of her
lodgers, who had arrived the day before, and
inscribed himself under the name of Germain,
blacksmith's apprentice.  Brought face to face with the
prisoner, she exclaimed immediately, "Oh yes! it
is he! most certainly!"
</p>

<p>
"And his papers!" asked Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"He had none!  Not even a passport!  They
had only found in his possession a set of keys, some
paper-money in <i>assignats</i>, a pocket-book, and some
small change in a purse."  As he spoke, Héron
placed these articles on the table.
</p>

<p>
"And no arms?" interposed Robespierre again.
</p>

<p>
The police-agent replied in the negative.
</p>

<p>
"Untie his hands.  We shall see if they are a
workman's."
</p>

<p>
Duplay examined them, the women watching
with great interest the while.  The carpenter
declared it to be very possible, as the hands looked
used to handling wood and iron.
</p>

<p>
"In war, most likely!" said Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible then stated his suspicions more
precisely.  The man was perhaps a <i>chouan</i>, come in
disguise from Vendée to stab him in the excitement
of the <i>fête</i>!
</p>

<p>
The women cried out in horror at the thought,
and added, "Of course he was not without accomplices!"
</p>

<p>
As this idea fastened in his mind, Robespierre
wished to know if the young man's room had been
searched.  Héron had not neglected to do so, as
could well be imagined!  He had, however, only
found a few scattered clothes and a valise, which
one of his men had with him.  He had brought it
to open before Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you say so, then?  Be quick and
open it!"
</p>

<p>
Héron tried a set of keys, and after some delay
the valise was unlocked.
</p>

<p>
The police-agent examined its contents, and
enumerated them: linen, articles of toilet, and an
ivory casket mounted in silver.  He took out the
ivory casket, which drew a cry of admiration from
mother Duplay, and passed it from hand to hand.
Héron then drew forth a rather heavy roll, from
which he tore the paper wrapper, disclosing a
number of <i>louis d'or</i>.  He deposited them on the table,
and set to work to count them, remarking that
the young apprentice was, after all, richer than
himself!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the agent continued his search.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, some letters!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Give them to Lebas," said Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
Lebas took the packet from the agent's hands.
</p>

<p>
"Go and examine them by the mantelpiece under
the lamp," Robespierre continued, "and tell me
their contents."
</p>

<p>
The curiosity of the women had now reached its
height.  Héron had drawn out a gold medallion,
encircled with small pearls.
</p>

<p>
"Those are real pearls," observed mother Duplay.
</p>

<p>
The medallion was opened, and found to contain
a lock of fair hair, with the initials M.T.  The
jewel was handed round, admired, and examined
carefully, giving rise to all sorts of reflections, in
Olivier's presence, who looked on apparently
unconcerned.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was exasperated at this indifference.
He knew, however, how to restrain himself, and
said mockingly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You will not tell me, I suppose, that there is
nothing extraordinary for a sum of money like that
and such jewels to be found in the possession of an
apprentice?"
</p>

<p>
Héron insinuated that perhaps he had stolen them,
at which Olivier simply shrugged his shoulders.
Duplay endorsed Héron's opinion.  In fact, he had
not the slightest doubt about it.  The young man
had stolen them.
</p>

<p>
Olivier could bear it no longer.
</p>

<p>
"Everything there belongs to me!" he said.
</p>

<p>
And as they seemed still to doubt, he repeated in
a loud voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Everything belongs to me!  And, since you
seem so anxious about it, know that I am an
aristocrat, a royalist, and a <i>chouan</i>!"
</p>

<p>
The men cried out almost with one voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"At last!  He owns it!"
</p>

<p>
Olivier took up the word at once.
</p>

<p>
"Very well!  Since I have owned it, why don't
you get quit of me, and send me forthwith to the
scaffold?  I am weary of it all!"
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre calmly told him not to be in
such a hurry, for he wished to know his name.  As
the young man defied him, saying he would have to
ask elsewhere, for he should never learn it from
him, Robespierre grew furious.  He must have his
name, and the names of his accomplices as well, for
he was not single-handed; that was certain!
</p>

<p>
"And if I have no accomplice, you will find
some, I'll be bound!" cried Olivier ironically.
"But you shall not have my name!"
</p>

<p>
Lebas, having finished the letters, came forward,
and Robespierre gave him a questioning glance.
The letters, he said, revealed nothing in particular.
They had been written two or three years ago, and
bore no address or signatures of importance.  Two
signed Marie Thérèse were apparently from a young
girl, the prisoner's sister or <i>fiancée</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Then the medallion belongs to her," put in
Victoire; "M.T. are the initials on it."
</p>

<p>
But these letters revealed nothing, nor did three
others signed "Your mother," couched in terms of
endearment and advice.  The style was most certainly
that of an aristocrat.  Only one letter&mdash;dated
1791&mdash;gave a slight indication, a very vague one.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre pricked up his ears&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And the contents of that letter?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Lebas scanned it once more.  It was dated 1791,
from a country place in one of the suburbs of Paris,
and addressed to the young man, then a student, by
his grandfather, who seemed also to be his godfather,
for he says: "I shall expect you to-morrow evening,
for my <i>fête</i> and yours, the Feast of St. Olivier."
</p>

<p>
"Is Olivier, then, his name?" inquired Robespierre,
looking at the young man.
</p>

<p>
But Lebas continued reading.  "The valet, my
dear child, will not fetch you this time.  At fifteen
a lad ought to be able to travel alone."
</p>

<p>
"The letter being dated May, 1791, the young
man must be now nineteen," Lebas observed.
</p>

<p>
"Nineteen! yes, just nineteen!" repeated Robespierre,
as if a thought had struck him.  "Go on!
Go on?  What comes next?"
</p>

<p>
Lebas continued: "My travelling-coach will wait
for you in the Rue des Lions, before the door of the
hotel."
</p>

<p>
"There can be only one Rue des Lions in Paris,
the Rue des Lions-Saint-Paul?" interposed Robespierre,
more and more impressed, and still looking
intently at the youth.
</p>

<p>
"Just so!" Lebas answered.
</p>

<p>
"Go on with the letter!  Go on!"
</p>

<p>
Lebas resumed his reading: "Benoit..."
</p>

<p>
"The concierge!" interrupted Robespierre,
scarcely able to hide his emotion.
</p>

<p>
Lebas went on: "Benoit will open the shutters
of the little room leading out of my study to the
garden.  In a bookcase, the one surmounted by the
busts of Cicero and Socrates, you will find just
within your reach, and will bring to me, volumes x. and
xi. of a set of folios bound in red morocco, with
the title..."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Arrêts du Parlement!</i>" exclaimed Robespierre,
to the general surprise, carried beyond himself by the
revelation which had suddenly burst upon him.
</p>

<p>
Olivier looked at him, in bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"That is it!  <i>Arrêts du Parlement</i>," repeated
Lebas; "but how did you know?"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, mastering his feelings, and without
taking his eyes off Olivier, answered with assumed
indifference&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I have had those books in my hands many
a time at Monsieur de Pontivy's, King's Councillor
in Parliament, and that young man's grandfather."
</p>

<p>
Olivier turned deadly pale, and grasped convulsively
at the back of a chair for support.  His
mother was lost!  Exclamations of surprise and
astonishment had greeted the Incorruptible's words.
Then Robespierre knew his family, and all about
him?  And all eyes were fixed on the young man
with renewed curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Yes ... I know," ... answered Robespierre,
forcing himself to appear calm, "I
know ... who he is..."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, now we shall hear the whole story!" they
all exclaimed, clapping their hands.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly you shall," Robespierre replied, "but
in order to make sure I should like to be alone with
him.  We are too many here; I shall call you back
presently.  Let Héron and the police-agents wait in
the courtyard."
</p>

<p>
Every one prepared to leave the room, looking
rather disappointed, specially the women, who
wondered what would be the outcome of it all.
</p>

<p>
As Lebas was passing out Robespierre stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go," he said, "I may want you."
</p>

<p>
And the three men remained alone.
</p>

<p>
The father was face to face with his son!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre's anger had all melted before this
sudden revelation.  He preserved, however, a stern
countenance, subduing the almost uncontrollable
emotion which threatened to overpower him.  He
was still struggling with it, trying to regain
possession of himself, and, moved by a natural impulse,
he told Olivier in a gentle voice to be seated.
</p>

<p>
The prisoner, however, did not heed him, and
when Robespierre repeated his words even more
persuasively, and in a trembling voice, Olivier still
paid no attention.  Seeing Lebas shrug his shoulders,
intimating that Robespierre was really very
good to insist, the Incorruptible explained&mdash;his eyes
still fixed on Olivier&mdash;that it was but natural for
him to show kindness towards the grandchild of a
man whose secretary he had been for eighteen
months.
</p>

<p>
The young man stared back in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"They never told you, then?" said Robespierre.
"Of course not....  They loathe my very name,
your people, do they not?"
</p>

<p>
But he immediately added, to Lebas's astonishment,
that this was no reason why he should forget
his stay in Monsieur de Pontivy's house.  He could
not help thinking now of the happy evenings he had
spent there and the many pleasant meals of which he
had partaken, side by side with Olivier's mother.
That dim, sweet spirit of the past, which the young
man's presence had called from its grave, had
softened his heart strangely towards him.
</p>

<p>
But Olivier interrupted him harshly.  Robespierre
might harden his heart again, then!  His life
was in Robespierre's hands!  He could take it if
it pleased him to do so.  All the family had been
victims to the Revolution: his grandfather who died
of grief, his uncle killed in Vendée, his father
mortally wounded defending the cause of the King....
</p>

<p>
"But your mother?  She is alive; you have not
the right to sacrifice her life!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre went on thus carefully, trying by well-placed
insinuations and questions to wring the truth
from him.  If Olivier had cried "Down with the
scaffold!" it was because he trembled for his
mother's life? ... because she was arrested?
</p>

<p>
"Am I not right in this?" he urged, with deep
anxiety.  "Is she not arrested?"
</p>

<p>
But he was met by a blunt denial.
</p>

<p>
And so the struggle between father and son went
on; the former impatient to learn the woman's
hiding-place, the latter firm and unshaken in his
refusal to betray it to one whom he regarded as a tiger
seeking his prey.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, though wounded by every syllable,
continued his soft persuasions.  What! was it
possible Olivier could not understand his wish to
protect his mother, and to place her out of harm's
reach, in memory of the time he had passed so
happily at her side?
</p>

<p>
Olivier smiled in bitter irony.  Robespierre need
not waste his words.  He well knew he had too
much pride to allow any such remembrance to
incline him to leniency.  Ah, there were memories
in that sweet past, as he called it, for which his
mother would pay with her head!  Friendship?
<i>Robespierre's friendship</i>!  Why, it paved the road to
the scaffold!  All his friends had trodden that
deadly path.
</p>

<p>
A cry of indignation escaped Lebas, but Robespierre
quieted him in a husky voice, himself a prey
to the most feverish agitation.  The lad's head had
been turned by the <i>chouans</i>!  He was not responsible
for what he said!  Then turning to Olivier he
tried, with a ring of sadness in his voice, to persuade
him that had he been a tyrant he would have
punished his insolence, he would not have attempted
to reason with him.  But Olivier remained
unmoved.  This kindness was assumed, he told himself,
to hide some dastardly plot!  Robespierre only
wanted to find his mother that he might avenge her
son's insult on herself.  In vain the Incorruptible
protested, deeply grieved and wounded.  Olivier
stoutly maintained his position, declaring that
Robespierre was not a man to pardon any one who had
publicly insulted him with such outspoken contempt
and hatred.
</p>

<p>
"Wretch!" cried out Lebas.
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre signed to him to stop.  Hatred?
That word in the young man's mouth sounded like
blasphemy.  And trying to master himself, that his
voice should not tremble, he asked him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Then you do hate me very much?"
</p>

<p>
Olivier again furiously asserted his abhorrence,
and was met by the question&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"When have I ever wronged you?"
</p>

<p>
At this Olivier, losing self-control, nearly betrayed
his secret.
</p>

<p>
"Wronged me! ... When have you wronged
me?" the young man repeated.  "Wasn't it
through you that my mother was..."
</p>

<p>
But recollecting himself he stopped short.
</p>

<p>
"Arrested?" put in Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"No!" exclaimed Olivier.
</p>

<p>
And then the struggle recommenced.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was, however, quite sure now of the
arrest.  What he wanted to know was the name of
the prison to which the two women had been taken,
and he came near to the chair by which the prisoner
was standing.  Olivier instinctively recoiled a step,
Robespierre, completely exhausted, made one last
effort.  He implored the young man to lay aside
his mistrust and hatred, to help him to save those
who were so dear to him.
</p>

<p>
"To help you to kill them, you mean!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre started from his seat, exasperated
beyond measure.  This was going too far!  Olivier
must be mad!  Could he not, would he not realise
that the very way to kill the two unhappy women
was to leave them for the executioner to do his
work!  Their turn would soon come.
</p>

<p>
"If yours does not come first!" interrupted
Olivier.
</p>

<p>
What madness!  Perhaps at this very moment
they were entering the cart which was to take them
to the Revolutionary Tribunal, and the next day to
the scaffold.  It was Olivier who was sending them
to death, and all because he was too obstinate to say
the word which would save them!  He was a blind,
unnatural son; he would kill his own mother!
</p>

<p>
Olivier, though amazed at Robespierre's persistence,
remained unshaken.
</p>

<p>
"Are you so thirsty for her blood?" he cried,
hurling at him this last insult.
</p>

<p>
At these words Robespierre lost all self-control.
</p>

<p>
"Fool!" he cried, "insensate fool!" as he paced
the room in unrestrained excitement.
</p>

<p>
But Lebas had heard enough.
</p>

<p>
"Let us have done with this madman," he said,
hurrying towards the door to call in the
police-agents.
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre turned round&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No!  Not yet!..."
</p>

<p>
Lebas, pretending not to have heard, called out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Héron!  Hér..."
</p>

<p>
Robespierre threw himself on him, and pinning
him to the wall, said breathlessly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Don't call, I tell you!  Don't call!"
</p>

<p>
Then lowering his voice he muttered in a dry
whisper&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet, man, I say!  Be quiet! ... It is
my son!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" and Lebas looked at him in stupefied
amazement.
</p>

<p>
When he had sufficiently recovered from his
surprise, he asked in a low voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why do you not tell him so?"
</p>

<p>
Could Robespierre tell him?  Tell the lad who
loathed him!  Would he believe him?  Olivier
would say it was false, or how could he hate him so?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  I cannot tell him that I am his
father!" he said sadly, sinking down exhausted
on a chair.
</p>

<p>
Lebas took his hand and pressed it sympathetically,
deeply touched.
</p>

<p>
"You are right!" he murmured.
</p>

<p>
And turning to Olivier he said aloud&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Then let us discover the prisoners without him!"
</p>

<p>
Olivier understood that matters were becoming
very serious.  However, Robespierre looked
discouraged.  How was it possible to find the women,
under their assumed names, in Vendée?  But Lebas
remarked that they might be in Paris.  At this
Olivier visibly trembled, which Lebas did not fail
to notice.
</p>

<p>
"Why," he continued&mdash;"why should he be so
far from them?"
</p>

<p>
The point of this remark struck Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, to be sure; you are right," he said, and
interpreting Lebas's thoughts he bade him take a
carriage and drive to each prison and interview every
woman that had been arrested with a young girl.
Lebas, who had already put on his hat, remarked
that he did not think the night would suffice; there
were so many women arrested with a daughter or a
younger sister.  And what if Olivier spoke the
truth, and his mother had been inscribed on the
prison-register under another name&mdash;her husband's,
for instance?
</p>

<p>
"Mauluçon," interrupted Robespierre, the name
suddenly recurring to him.
</p>

<p>
Lebas took out a note-book from his pocket.
Was he a soldier, or a magistrate, this Mauluçon?
Robespierre could not say.  All he knew of him
was that among the people represented as having
gone into mourning for Louis XVI. he had seen
the names of Pontivy, his son-in-law Mauluçon,
and his daughter Clarisse.
</p>

<p>
"Clarisse!" repeated Lebas, stopping his
note-taking.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre looked at him in surprise.  In what
way could that name interest him?  Lebas had now
closed his note-book, deep in thought.  Clarisse?
Olivier's mother was called Clarisse?  But the
woman who implored Robespierre's clemency for
her son, aged nineteen, the woman whose letter he
had refused to read just now ...
</p>

<p>
"Was signed Clarisse?" cried Robespierre
breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Lebas.
</p>

<p>
"That is his mother!"...
</p>

<p>
And pointing to the young man, who was on the
brink of swooning.
</p>

<p>
"You see, it is she!  Look at him; there is no
mistaking, it is she!"
</p>

<p>
"She is at the prison of La Bourbe, then," said
Lebas.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre could no longer hide his joy, at last
he knew where to find them!
</p>

<p>
But he was interrupted by a cry of pain.
Olivier, thinking his mother now irretrievably lost,
had fainted away.  Robespierre ran to him, and
bending over tried to bring him to consciousness,
gently reassuring him, swearing he was going to
give the prisoners their liberty.
</p>

<p>
But Lebas, who was also bending over the young
man, reminded the Incorruptible that Olivier no
longer heard him.  Then Robespierre, with infinite
precautions, assisted by Lebas, lifted him into an
armchair, and taking a bottle of scent left behind
by the ladies, gently bathed Olivier's temples with
the perfume.  Lebas, rather anxious lest Robespierre's
paternal solicitude should be discovered, remained
on the watch, imploring him to be prudent.
</p>

<p>
"Some one might come in!" he urged.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, entirely taken up with Olivier,
shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Let them come!" he said impatiently.  "I
have a right surely to pardon my own son!"
</p>

<p>
Lebas recalled him to reality.
</p>

<p>
No! he had no right to pardon a <i>chouan</i>, who
had insulted the Republic the day before in
presence of the whole nation.  Robespierre's enemies
would seize the occasion to cite the example of
Brutus sacrificing his son to the interest of his
country.  They would exact from him a like proof
of patriotism....
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was trying to loosen Olivier's cravat,
but not succeeding asked Lebas's assistance.  After
all, he was right, especially as his enemies on the
Committee of Public Safety, out of hatred for him,
would kill the lad all the quicker.  Opening the
collar gently, he continued the while to reason
about it, saying that the only means of saving him
was to throw him brutally into prison, so as to
mislead them, and to get him out secretly after
three days.
</p>

<p>
The young man heaved a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"He is coming to," said Robespierre, checking
his speculations.
</p>

<p>
Lebas observed that it was high time to let others
come in; they would wonder at the length of the
cross-examining.  Robespierre assented, his eyes
fixed on his son, who seemed now coming to
himself.  As the Incorruptible bent over him to
ascertain if this was so, his lips touched the pale
forehead.
</p>

<p>
But he heard steps, and had only time to pull
himself up, when Héron entered, followed by his
men.
</p>

<p>
Héron looked straight at Olivier, who had now
recovered his senses.
</p>

<p>
"What!  Did he faint?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had regained possession of himself,
and at once assumed a brutal demeanour.  Yes,
the scoundrel had been playing a farce, and an
infamous farce too!  The family now entered also,
brimming with curiosity and questions.
</p>

<p>
"Has the young man made a confession?"
</p>

<p>
"No; but he has betrayed himself, and I know
all that I desired."
</p>

<p>
General satisfaction was expressed.  At last,
then, he was caught, and his accomplices!  At
this moment Madame Lebas and Victoire discovered
in what a sad state Olivier was.  Had he
been ill, then?  They would have come to him;
but Robespierre stopped them, assuming contempt.
</p>

<p>
"It was better," he said, "to leave the young
madman alone, for he really did not deserve that
any one should take interest in him."
</p>

<p>
"Monster!" Olivier groaned.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had heard the word.  He took hold
of Lebas's arm, as if for support, and pressed it
convulsively.  Then, in a voice which he tried to
render harsh, he told him to conduct Olivier to
the Prison de la Force.  Héron had only waited
for this; and his men seized their prisoner, who at
the roughness of the police-agents gave a sharp
cry.
</p>

<p>
"You brutes!" exclaimed Robespierre, in a
faltering voice, taking a step towards his son in
spite of himself.  But Lebas stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful!" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre sat down, realising his imprudence.
</p>

<p>
Lebas again whispered to him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Don't be uneasy, I will watch over him."
</p>

<p>
And telling the men not to handle the prisoner
too roughly, he went out with them.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre watched his son disappear, and when
he had gone he felt some one take his hand.  This
made him tremble.  It was Cornélie.
</p>

<p>
How tired he seemed!  Every one was around
him now.  That young madman had given him
terrible trouble, hadn't he?
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he replied, wiping his temple, "it was
very trying!  Exceedingly trying!"
</p>

<p>
Duplay remarked that, judging from the length
of the cross-examination, he must have learnt
something very important.  Robespierre made a gesture,
as if protesting.  Then rising abruptly he took
leave of the company, on the pretext of urgent
work.
</p>

<p>
"The lad can rest assured," said Duplay, "it is
his death-warrant our friend has gone to sign."
</p>

<p>
"What a pity!" observed Victoire; "the young
fellow seemed so nice!"
</p>

<p>
But mother Duplay stopped her daughter indignantly,
asking her if she was mad.  What would
the Incorruptible say if he could hear her?
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
HOURS OF ANGUISH
</h3>

<p>
Once in his room, Robespierre sank exhausted
into a chair.  At last he was alone!  He could
now give free vent to his long suppressed emotion.
The feeling uppermost at the moment was one of
dread dismay, as the terrible position rose before
his mind, with all its fearful consequences.  He
gave no thought to the insult, it was the fate of the
two women which haunted him.  If he saved them
it would atone for all in the eyes of his son.  They
had been arrested, thrown into prison, and cast for
death, but he would set them free.
</p>

<p>
Who had arrested them?  What had they done?
Were they implicated in some seditious plot which
would render it difficult to deliver them?  As to
Olivier's release, he would see to that.  By causing
things to drag a little, Olivier's trial could be put
off until Robespierre had the power in his own
hands, and could act as he liked towards his son.
It was after all his concern, for it was he whom
Olivier had insulted, and not the Republic, which
he could not yet impersonate.  Had he even been
proclaimed dictator, and sole representative of France,
he would, he supposed, have had the right to pardon.
It would seem but natural that his first act on
accession to power should be an act of clemency!
The most important thing then at present was that
Olivier should remain in prison as long as
possible under the closest supervision.
</p>

<p>
But again, why had the women been arrested?
By whose orders?  They were perhaps at that very
moment at the Conciergerie, on their trial, before
the Revolutionary Tribunal.  He could, no doubt,
secure their acquittal, but what if the inquiry brought
Olivier's name to light?
</p>

<p>
"I am wandering!" he caught himself exclaiming.
How, indeed, could the name of Olivier be
mentioned during the trial?  The young man had
nothing to do with it.  He had insulted Robespierre,
it was to him personally he had to answer.
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible rubbed his eyes, unable longer
to follow the thread of his own thoughts.  He was
suddenly reminded of the law to be submitted by
him next day to the Convention, the vindictive law
which would ensure conviction without proof,
evidence, or even cross-examination.  This law would
be of twofold service to him; it would rekindle
the Terror, would help Robespierre to get rid of
those who were still in his way, and be the means
of reducing the two women to silence, thus saving
not only Olivier's life, but theirs also.  Olivier
would then see that Robespierre was not the monster
he imagined, for he would owe the lives of his
mother and of his <i>fiancée</i> to him, the very man he
had so wantonly insulted!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre's reflections were suddenly
interrupted by a knock.  He started up.  Some one
was calling him.  He listened, and recognising
Lebas's voice, hastened to open the door.
</p>

<p>
"I saw a light through your window," said
Lebas, "and knew you had not yet gone to bed."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what have you learnt?" Robespierre
asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"They are still at the prison of La Bourbe."
</p>

<p>
"Both of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, both of them."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" sighed Robespierre, with relief.
</p>

<p>
"And I have given strict instructions in your
name, that they were not to be allowed out, under
any circumstances.  I am quite satisfied on that
point, since the Concierge knows that they have
been arrested by your orders."
</p>

<p>
"By my orders?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, alas!"
</p>

<p>
And he whispered to the Incorruptible, as if
fearing to be heard&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"They are the two women from Montmorency."
</p>

<p>
"The women of the forest?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre leant back against his desk for
support.  Lebas pulled an armchair towards him, into
which he sank quite overcome.
</p>

<p>
"You could not have prevented it!" said Lebas
gently; "nowadays surprises of that sort are
common enough.  How could you know?"
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible gave no reply, but seemed lost
in a dream.
</p>

<p>
"Take some rest now....  You must feel
exhausted....  I feel so myself....  <i>Au revoir</i>
till to-morrow.  After all, why should you worry?
Are we not the masters?"
</p>

<p>
"That is the question!" murmured Robespierre,
without lifting his eyes.
</p>

<p>
But Lebas had just closed the door, and wished
him good night.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, left alone, resumed his train of
thought.  He had, himself, then, ordered the two
women to be arrested.  This made everything clear
to his mind!  He now understood why Olivier had
insulted him, and matters were more complicated
than he had imagined.  But what was Clarisse
doing at Montmorency?  How had she gained
acquaintance with that man Vaughan, who had
proposed to him the Regency in the name of
England?  For one moment he was vain enough to
think that Clarisse had acted in conjunction with
the Englishman.  She had perhaps an idea of
winning Robespierre over to the Royalist cause, and
of rendering homage to his exalted position and
power, realising all the good he could do.  If this
were indeed the fact, then she knew everything, was
aware of the Englishman's proposals, and of the
forest interview!  She was in possession of his
secret and could by a single word completely ruin
him!
</p>

<p>
No!  No!  He was raving! ... Why! he was
accusing the mother of his child!  For she was the
mother of his son!  Then he alone was in fault;
... he who had her arrested for no reason!  For no
reason?  Was that so certain?  And he sought
about in his mind for excuses.  Yes! he was the
dupe of Fate, the tool of blind Destiny!  Why had
Clarisse been there?  Why had she been implicated
with the secret interview?  Why?  Ah! why?
</p>

<p>
With closed eyes, still repeating that unanswered
"Why?" he fell into a half sleep.  Little by little
the image of a cell in the prison of La Bourbe rose
before him; Clarisse was there.  She appeared to
him, as he had seen her in her youth, at the Rue des
Lions, with her sweet pale face, large blue eyes,
fair silken hair, so fair ... so fair....  He began
to wonder that one so young and frail should have
a son so big as Olivier!  His dream-thoughts became
more confused....  She was now Olivier's <i>fiancée</i>....
He was promising her to marry them in London,
through the intervention of Vaughan ... of
Fox....  Fox was all powerful in England, as he,
Robespierre, was in France....  His head gradually
sunk on his shoulder, and he fell asleep at last.
</p>

<p>
The lamp, turned very low, shed upon him a
flickering light, pale and subdued as the glow of a
sanctuary lamp, softening as if in pity the stern lines
of his troubled countenance, which even in sleep
did not relax the painful contraction of its features.
He had fallen asleep, dressed as he was, his head
aslant, his arms hanging by his sides listlessly.  Now
and then, his whole frame would twitch and quiver
nervously, and vague, incoherent words escaped his
lips at intervals; harsh, guttural sounds fell from
him suddenly in that silent apartment, whose curtains
and drapery in the subdued light assumed the soft
and delicate tints of a young girl's chamber.
</p>

<p>
Its hangings were really of damask, with designs
of white flowers on a blue ground, cut out of an old
dress by Madame Duplay.  This was the one
obvious attempt at ornament.  The Incorruptible's
room was otherwise very modestly furnished,
containing only the armchair in which he had fallen
asleep, a few cane chairs, a very simple desk, a
plain deal bookcase overladen with books and
fastened to the wall, and a bed of walnut-wood.
</p>

<p>
The room was situated, as already said, in a wing
which connected the main building occupied by the
Duplay family with an outhouse opening on the Rue
Saint-Honoré.  It also communicated with little
Maurice's room, to whom the Incorruptible in his
leisure hours gave lessons in history, and on the
duties of a citizen.  The child, who had been sent
early to bed on the arrival of the police-agents with
Olivier, now slept soundly.
</p>

<p>
At about three o'clock, the boy awoke with a
start.  He heard a noise in the next room, and,
thinking he recognised Robespierre's voice, turned
over to sleep again.  It was not the first time his
good friend had talked aloud in his sleep.  But he
was awakened again by the falling of a chair, and
jumped from his bed anxiously and ran to open the
door.  In the flickering light of the nearly
extinguished lamp he discerned the Incorruptible standing
erect, still dressed, and gesticulating wildly as if
pushing some one back.  The boy advanced towards
him, asking what was amiss.  Robespierre stared at
him with a frightened look, then folding him in his
arms, he fell on his knees moaning.  Between his
groans the child could catch the words&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My son! ... My son!"
</p>

<p>
Then the lamp went quite out.
</p>

<p>
The child gently disengaged himself.  <i>Bon ami</i>
had called him his son!  Yes, he was his son, his
affectionate and dutiful son.  Then with tender
solicitude he helped him to rise.  The day was
already peeping through the half-closed shutters.
Maurice with some difficulty succeeded in replacing
his friend on the armchair in which he had passed
the night, and asked him if he wished for anything.
But Robespierre had fallen asleep again.
</p>

<p>
The boy returned to his room, walking backwards
on tiptoe, fearing to awaken him, and went to
bed again.
</p>

<p>
At seven o'clock in the morning Robespierre
opened his eyes.  He remembered nothing.  The
fact of having slept in his clothes, and in an armchair,
did not surprise him.  He had often done so in the
days of sore trial.  He drew aside the curtains, and
the room was suddenly flooded with daylight.  Some
one knocked.  It was Maurice Duplay, asking if he
could come in.
</p>

<p>
The boy's early visit surprised Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"Are you well, <i>bon ami</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, why?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing ... only ... last night ... you know..."
</p>

<p>
"Last night?  Well!"
</p>

<p>
"You rather frightened me!"
</p>

<p>
"Frightened you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you frightened me!"
</p>

<p>
The child then told him what had taken place in
the night.
</p>

<p>
"Are you quite sure?" asked Robespierre anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! quite sure, and since you called me your
son it shows you recognised me, and had not the
fever so badly after all."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are right!  It was nothing since
... as you said ... since I recognised you; ... for
it was you of course I called my son: ... you <i>are</i>
my good little son, are you not?"
</p>

<p>
And he patted his cheeks, adding&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But you must not speak of it to anybody! not
to anybody, mind!  It is not worth while worrying
your father and mother."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no!  I have never said anything!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre began again to feel uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?  You have <i>never</i> said anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, it is not the first time it has happened to you."
</p>

<p>
"Have you heard me before, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes! speaking loud in your sleep."
</p>

<p>
"And what did I say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I never understood anything, ... disconnected
words, that's all....  And then I was so
accustomed, I did not pay much attention.  But
last night it was too much and I got up."
</p>

<p>
"You should not have done so, it was nothing
more serious than usual, only the worry and bother
that upset me so."
</p>

<p>
"It was the cross-examination of the Chouan
yesterday which unstrung you, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps; ... it may be....  But, you see,
now I am quite well."
</p>

<p>
As the lad was going he called after him.
</p>

<p>
"Now you know, and you won't give it another
thought, will you?  And not a word, mind, not a
word!  Now go, child."
</p>

<p>
He was subject to such nightmares then?
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I don't take enough exercise," he
thought, and he resolved to go out at once into the
open air.  A good walk to the Champs-Elysées
would completely revive him.  He changed his
clothes, shaved, powdered and perfumed himself as
usual, and had actually started, but went back and
took from a drawer in his desk the draft of the new
law which he had prepared the day before, and put
it in his pocket.  He had decided after reflection
not to submit it himself, but to confide it to Couthon,
one of the most faithful of his friends on the
Committee with Lebas, Saint-Just, and Augustin.
Couthon would read the document from the tribune,
and this would leave him fresh and fit for the
ensuing debate.
</p>

<p>
Having called at Couthon's house, and concluded
this arrangement, Robespierre made his way to the
Champs-Elysées through the Tuileries with his dog
Blount, who gambolled joyously in his new-found
freedom after a three days' confinement in the
house.  The Incorruptible walked quickly and
briskly as usual, in spite of the intense heat, which
was but little diminished by the shade of the chestnuts
lining the avenue.  He was already telling over
in his mind those among his enemies who would be
the first victims of the new law.  As to Olivier and
the two women, it was quite decided.  They should
remain in prison in the most absolute secrecy until
the time came for him to be master.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the avenue he turned into the
Allée de Veuves and went towards the Seine.
Blount, who had scented the water, leapt and
bounded forward in high glee.  On fine summer days
the dog used to swim in the river under the eyes
of Robespierre.  When he reached the banks of
the Seine Blount was awaiting him, and at a sign
jumped in the water, and the Incorruptible found
some release from his harrowing thoughts in
watching the gambols of his dog in the river.
</p>

<p>
At the Convention the Bill read by Couthon was
received with loud protests, and the subsequent
debate opened amid turbulence and uproar.  That
the judgments of the Revolutionary Tribunal should
be accelerated by the suppression of evidence and
cross-examinations had already frightened not a few;
but when it became a question of transmitting to the
Committee of Public Safety the right of life or
death, the whole assembly was filled with fear.  Up
to that time the Convention alone had the right to
sit in judgment on a representative of the people!
</p>

<p>
A voice was heard exclaiming&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If that law is passed, nothing is left but to blow
out our brains!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre appeared in the tribune.  The Bill
was voted.  The next day several attempts were
made in the Convention to repeal the atrocious law
which brought the Terror into their very midst, but
all such efforts failed.
</p>

<p>
With so trenchant a law, a two-edged weapon
which could be turned at will either against the
Committee of Public Safety or against the
Convention, according to the intricate windings of his
subtle policy, with such a weapon Robespierre
could keep his enemies of the Committee at bay.
He had in future but to accuse them, and have them
replaced by creatures of his own, satellites of
his will.
</p>

<p>
However, all was going well.  His adversaries,
blind and unwary, had begun to tear each other to
pieces in party disputes, and to split up into factions,
the very day after the passing of the atrocious law
which made him so dreaded.
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible tried to take advantage of these
cabals, but he was too hasty.  The Committee,
realising their danger, united against him; and this
was the prelude to a terrible and decisive struggle,
for in case of failure there remained nothing for
Robespierre but to have recourse to force.  Realising
this to the full, he no longer attended the sittings
of the Committee, but worked silently in the shade,
preparing the <i>coup d'état</i> which was to rid him at
once and for ever of all his enemies,&mdash;with
Saint-Just, whom he had sent for from the Northern
Army, with Hauriot, Commander-in-Chief of the
armed force; Fleuriot-Lescot, Mayor of Paris;
Payan, Agent of the Commune; and Dumas, President;
and Coffinhal, Vice-President of the Revolutionary
Tribunal.  His design was very simple.
He would denounce his adversaries of the Committee
of Public Safety at the bar of the Convention
and ask for their arrest and judgment.  Should the
Convention resist, he would subdue them with the
help of Hauriot and his troops, and of all sections
of the Commune, who on a sign from him and from
Fleuriot, Payan, Dumas, Coffinhal, and their friends,
would be stirred to insurrection, and would take the
Tuileries by storm.
</p>

<p>
As to Olivier and the two women, they were
always under his hand.  Olivier, at La Force
Prison, was in no way disturbed.  Clarisse and
Thérèse had been kept at La Bourbe by his orders.
Twice the names of Olivier's mother and <i>fiancée</i> had
appeared on the list of the Revolutionary Tribunal,
and twice their names had been struck off by Robespierre,
who, anxious and watchful, took care that all
lists should be submitted to him.
</p>

<p>
Soon the decisive hour approached.  It was the
7th Thermidor.  Six weeks had elapsed since the
memorable Fête of the Supreme Being, and the
passing of the horrible Prairial law, which had sent
hundreds of victims to the scaffold.  The Terror
was at its height, and France, prostrate before the
knife of the guillotine, was awaiting in distracted
anxiety the result of the struggle.  The guillotine
was also waiting, ready to devour whichever of the
two parties was vanquished&mdash;Robespierre's
opponents or Robespierre himself and his partisans.
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible, driven to the last extremity,
had fixed the battle for the next day, the 8th
Thermidor, when he would throw off his mask and
accuse his adversaries of the Committee of Public
Safety in presence of the Convention.  Although he
was almost certain of the issue, he deemed it none
the less prudent to take infinite precautions, and to
put Olivier and the two women in perfect safety, in
case of defeat, however impossible it might seem.
They must be taken from prison, and all three
placed in some secure retreat, out of the reach of
danger, from whence they could escape if necessary.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre thought of the Hôtel de Ville, where
he reigned supreme.  Behind this, in the Rue du
Martroy, were some unoccupied apartments, in a
building connected with and forming part of the
hotel.  Clarisse might live there with her niece and
Olivier until they could with safety leave Paris.
He unfolded his projects to Lebas, who alone knew
of the secret drama which poisoned the private life
of the Incorruptible at the very moment when his
public career was reaching its climax.  Lebas
approved the plan.
</p>

<p>
"I am entirely at your service!"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  I was counting on your help.  But
don't let us be too hasty.  To-morrow will be time
enough.  Everything depends on the sitting.  If
you see that the majority hesitate from the
commencement, go immediately to La Bourbe and take
the two women out, then to La Force and see about
my son.  The apartments are ready.  You have
only to take them there.  But save the women first.
Olivier must find his mother and his <i>fiancée</i> when
he arrives."
</p>

<p>
Then taking two papers from his pocket, he
added, "Here are the warrants of release."
</p>

<p>
"Agreed!" said Lebas, after reading them.
</p>

<p>
Next day at the Convention, Lebas, a parliamentary
expert, judged that Robespierre would come out
victorious from the contest, nor was he mistaken.
The Incorruptible had brought a general accusation,
without mentioning names, against members of the
Committee of Public Safety and General Security.
This was received in anxious silence, a few only
daring to protest.  But the printing of the speech,
and its circulation in all the communes of Paris, was
none the less voted.  It was an official accusation,
by the voice of Robespierre, of his adversaries, before
the whole of France.  It was victory; and nothing
was left but to name the victims.
</p>

<p>
But the implicated members of the Committee of
Public Safety did not give him time.  Vadier boldly
made for the tribune, followed by Cambon, who,
feeling it was a case of kill or cure, played a daring
game, and replied to the general accusation of
Robespierre by a direct, personal accusation, denouncing
him openly to the astonished Assembly.  The real
traitor, he declared, was this masterful Robespierre,
who paralysed the will of the National Convention!
</p>

<p>
There was a counter-wave of feeling among the
members of the Assembly at this public indictment,
and censure of their slavish submission to Robespierre.
They seemed suddenly to realise their position,
and the more daring members, seeing the tide
turn, prepared for the fight.  Thus the attacked
were in their turn attacking.
</p>

<p>
Billaud-Varennes succeeded Cambon at the tribune.
</p>

<p>
"The mask must be torn aside, no matter whose
face it covers!" he cried.  "I would rather my
corpse should be the stepping-stone of the ambitious
than by my silence be an accomplice of their
crimes!"
</p>

<p>
Others succeeded Billaud-Varennes, reiterating
his accusations more boldly and insultingly.
Robespierre, disconcerted, tried to face the storm,
but it was too late.  In confining himself to a
general accusation, in mentioning no names, he had
frightened every one.  The Assembly revoked their
previous decision, and amended the Bill.  The
speech was not to be sent to the Communes, but
to the Committee, to be examined.
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried Robespierre, "I have the courage
to make before the Convention revelations which
I believe necessary to the salvation of the country,
and my speech is to be submitted for examination
to the very men whom I accuse!"
</p>

<p>
Victory had been followed by defeat; a partial
defeat, it was true, for, seeing the hesitating attitude
of the Convention, Robespierre hoped to win them
back again the next day.  He must, however, be
prepared for every emergency!  That very evening
he would take steps to organise an insurrection of
the Communes, which, in case of resistance, would
annihilate the whole set of dastardly cowards.  The
Incorruptible wished to act within legal bounds as
long as possible, and only to overstep them when
forced to do so.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre looked round for Lebas, but he had
disappeared, and this gave him grounds for hope
that the two women, and perhaps Olivier, had
reached the private apartments chosen by him in the
Rue du Martroy.
</p>

<p>
"I must go and make sure that all is well," he
said to himself; "there is not a moment to lose"&mdash;and
leaving the Convention, he hastened in the
direction of the Hôtel de Ville.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
THE TUMBRILS
</h3>

<p>
At that very moment Lebas reached the Hôtel
de Ville with Clarisse and Thérèse.  On leaving
the prison of La Bourbe he had given a false
address to the coachman who drove the prisoners,
and he followed them at a distance in another
carriage, accompanied by a man to superintend
the luggage, who was one of the attendants at the
Hôtel de Ville, and a devoted adherent of
Robespierre.  The second carriage soon overtook the
first, when Lebas gave the correct address to the
driver&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"13, Rue du Martroy!"
</p>

<p>
Clarisse and Thérèse mounted the stairs more
dead than alive, ushered up respectfully by Lebas,
and Urbain, the attendant, carrying their luggage.
Where were they going?  Who were these people?
Lebas at the prison had scarcely spoken to Clarisse.
</p>

<p>
"For your safety," he had said simply, "for
your niece's safety, do not question me before we
arrive at our destination."
</p>

<p>
For her safety?  For Thérèse's safety!  Then
they were to be saved?  Who could save them?
She would surely learn now who it was.
</p>

<p>
The two men stopped on the third floor, and
Urbain opened a door.
</p>

<p>
"It is here!" said Lebas, making way for them
to pass in.
</p>

<p>
The two women entered, and found themselves
in a plain sitting-room with fittings and furniture
of dark grey wood.  Urbain took the luggage to a
door opening on the left, through which a bedroom
was visible.
</p>

<p>
"You must make yourself quite at home, here,"
said Lebas.
</p>

<p>
And he informed them that they were free, but
from motives of prudence he who had saved them,
and for whom Lebas was acting, had judged it
advisable to offer them these apartments as a
temporary residence, where they would be entirely out of
danger's reach.  Clarisse and Thérèse could not
recover from their surprise, and wished to know to
whom they owed their deliverance.  But Lebas
would not tell them, having received no orders to
that effect.  All he could say to reassure them was
that their protector was all-powerful at the Paris
Commune, and that the apartments were in direct
communication, through a door which he indicated,
with the Hôtel de Ville, so that they were under
his immediate care.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse started.  She understood now.  She owed
her safety to the Incorruptible!  Her letter of the
preceding month had reached Robespierre.  She
knew this already, as he had acknowledged it in a
few brief words three days after receiving it&mdash;"Fear
nothing, your son is safe!" And this was
all she had heard.
</p>

<p>
Lebas was still giving the women particulars of
their new surroundings.  Everything had been
arranged to render them as comfortable as possible.
The man who had accompanied them was entirely
at their disposal, and it was to his interest to serve
them well.  His wife would see also to their wants,
and take charge of their apartments, where they
would be absolutely free and unrestrained.
</p>

<p>
Only one precaution was earnestly recommended
to them; to show themselves as little as possible at
the windows of their sitting or bed room, so as not
to attract the attention of neighbours.  They were
especially told to avoid this in the afternoon, from
four to six.  The windows looked on to the Rue du
Martroy, through which the carts carrying the
condemned passed.  The scaffold was now installed at
the Barrière du Trône Renversé, and it was the
shortest way.
</p>

<p>
The two women shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"Unhappily we had no choice," Lebas added,
seeing their repugnance, "but you will be warned
by the cries of the crowd, and you can then retire
to the dining-room which looks on to the courtyard.
It lasts but a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes,
at the most."
</p>

<p>
But Clarisse scarcely listened, her whole mind
occupied with one thought, the longing to inform
Olivier, whose whereabouts she hoped soon to learn,
of their release from prison.
</p>

<p>
"Could I write a few words to some one who is
very dear to me?" she asked.  "I wish to set his
mind at rest about our welfare."
</p>

<p>
Lebas replied in the affirmative, and she thanked
him gratefully.  He politely protested; she owed
him no thanks, these were solely due to him whose
orders he was executing.  He then offered to take
the letter himself, saying he would return for it in a
quarter of an hour, as he had another urgent duty to
fulfil.  And he retired, leaving the two women with
Urbain, who busied himself arranging the furniture
of the sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
Thérèse, now full of hope, gave thanks to God.
They would perhaps soon see Olivier again.  What
joy!  But to whom did they owe their release?
She looked inquiringly at her aunt.  Clarisse owned
that she believed it was to an ex-secretary of
Thérèse's grandfather, now all-powerful, and to whom
she had written from the prison of La Bourbe.
Thérèse seemed astonished that her aunt had not
told her of this.  But Clarisse made the very plausible
excuse that she did not wish to raise her hopes,
not knowing whether her appeal would have success.
</p>

<p>
The young girl was now looking through the
shutters of one of the windows which Urbain had
partly opened.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! there is a church!" she exclaimed, and
immediately she thought that if they were allowed
to go out she would go and pray for their protector,
for he could not be all-powerful and not have done
wrong; he must belong also to the Government of
Terror.
</p>

<p>
At the mention of a church, Clarisse approached
the window.  She recognised the building; it was
St. Gervais Church, on whose portal could be read
in large letters the sadly ironical inscription:
"National Property, to be let as a Warehouse."
</p>

<p>
At Clarisse's request Urbain had placed an ink-stand
and blotting-paper on the table, and Clarisse
hearing it was ready turned round joyfully.  "At
last I can write to Olivier!" she thought.
</p>

<p>
She then seated herself at the table and began to
write, while Thérèse was making a tour round the
room, taking a survey of the furniture.  Suddenly
catching sight of an illustrated paper on a sofa, she
took it up to pass the time away.  It was five weeks
old, and had been preserved no doubt on account of
the illustrations.  Its pages gave an elaborate
account of the Fête of the Supreme Being of which
she had heard Olivier speak, and against which he
had so vehemently protested during his visit to the
prison of La Bourbe.  It had taken place, then?
</p>

<p>
She became interested and commenced reading to
herself in a low voice: "<i>Description of the
Procession.&mdash;Fireworks at the Fountain of the
Tuileries.&mdash;Typical Groups.&mdash;Arrest of a
Chouan.&mdash;Popular Indignation!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"I saw that myself," interrupted Urbain.
</p>

<p>
Thérèse turned to the servant, who was now dusting
the mantelpiece, and asked him why the man had
been arrested.
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Because he cried: 'Down with the
scaffold!'"
</p>

<p>
The words struck Clarisse, who looked up from
her writing.  Only the day before the <i>fête</i> Olivier
had reproached the French for not daring to throw
that cry in the teeth of the Government of Terror.
Thérèse, seeing her aunt look up from her writing,
was struck with the same coincidence, and both,
almost in the same breath, questioned the domestic,
who said that, as far as he could remember, the young
man appeared to be about twenty.  He had been
arrested at once to save him from the crowd, who
would otherwise have torn him to pieces.
</p>

<p>
"His name? his name?" they both gasped.
</p>

<p>
That Urbain could not tell them.  Clarisse rose,
mastering her emotion, and with all a mother's solicitude
set herself to reassure Thérèse.  Yes, they both
had the same thought, hadn't they?  She also was
thinking of Olivier, but it could not be he.  He
would have written to them.  Why, it was six
weeks ago, and his visit to the prison would have
been remembered!  They would have been involved,
but they had, on the contrary, been in no way made
to feel it, and had been treated with every consideration.
</p>

<p>
"That is true," answered Thérèse, glad enough
to be convinced.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse took the paper gently from her hands,
saying, "Instead of reading all this awful news, which
inflames your imagination, go, dear, and arrange our
room a little."  And she added in half a reproachful
tone: "You have not even looked at it, yet!"
</p>

<p>
Then gently pushing her into the room, she shut
the door sharply behind her.
</p>

<p>
A terrible fear had taken possession of Clarisse.
Why in his letter to her had Robespierre sedulously
avoided mentioning Olivier's whereabouts?  Turning
to Urbain, she addressed him in a hoarse voice:
"You say you saw this young fellow?"
</p>

<p>
The good man evinced surprise at her strange
recurrence to the subject.
</p>

<p>
"I had the honour to tell you so just now, <i>citoyenne</i>."
</p>

<p>
Then Urbain would recollect him?  What was
he like?  His face?  The colour of his eyes?
But that was too much to ask.  He was in such a
state, so broken down.  How was he dressed?
</p>

<p>
Urbain could just remember.  He described the
costume: grey carmagnole and breeches, black and
grey striped waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
It was Olivier's costume!  There was no longer
any possible doubt.  It was he!
</p>

<p>
"It is he!  It is he!" she kept repeating, falling
at last into a chair, on the point of swooning.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the door opened and a man appeared,
who without crossing the threshold signed
to the servant, to whom he spoke in a whisper.
Urbain came towards Clarisse and delivered the
message.  "The <i>citoyen</i> Robespierre wishes to speak
with you."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?  Oh! let him come! let him
come!" she cried through her blinding tears.
</p>

<p>
The man left the room followed by Urbain.
Clarisse waited in breathless suspense, her eyes fixed
in mute agony on the half-opened door.
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible came in, and before he had
time to greet her, she had risen and was standing
before him.
</p>

<p>
"My son?  Where is my son?"
</p>

<p>
"Be assured, your son is safe."
</p>

<p>
She recoiled a step and fixed her eyes on him in
amazed silence.
</p>

<p>
So it was true, the young man who had been
arrested was Olivier!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, greatly agitated, again essayed to
reassure her, but she interrupted him eagerly.  Where
was he?  In prison?
</p>

<p>
Robespierre lowered his eyes.
</p>

<p>
What!  Had Olivier been sent to prison by him?
Ah! things had come to a pretty pass.  He was
then the gaoler of his own son!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre made a gesture as if to protest.  Then,
mastering with difficulty his emotion, he explained
everything.  He had kept Olivier in prison as the
only means of saving him.  Had the lad been
released he would have been reimprisoned by the
Committee of Public Safety, who would have sent
him to the scaffold, if it were only to show
Robespierre that he had no right to grant a pardon!  But
Olivier would be free now.  Lebas was at that very
moment at La Force prison, and would soon bring
him secretly from thence to them.  Olivier should
remain with his mother and Thérèse until the day
when they could all three leave without danger,
and seek safety in the provinces.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse listened, now calm and reassured.  But
how had Robespierre known?
</p>

<p>
"Who he was?  Oh, in the most unexpected
manner, with the assistance of some letters found in
his valise, for he absolutely refused to give me his
name."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse looked at Robespierre with a new fear
in her eyes.  Then he had seen him?  Olivier
knew the terrible secret of his birth?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" replied the Incorruptible sadly, "don't
be uneasy about that.  I have not said a word, to
lessen his love and trust in you, or disarm the
bitter hatred he has for me, which avenges you too
well..."
</p>

<p>
But Clarisse interrupted him.  Robespierre was
mistaking her feelings.  She did not ask to be
avenged, she did not even think any more of
reproaching him with the past which divided them.
It was all so far, so far away, that past!
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible looked at her with eyes full of
sadness and regret.  Yes, there she stood, in her
faded prison dress, her face lined before its time, a
living reproach, a poor pale ghost of bygone days.
Those blanched lips, with their melancholy droop,
the token of long suffering and resignation, those
lips had received his first kiss!
</p>

<p>
Clarisse would think no more of the past!  He
thought of it though, thought of it there, looking at
her.  Had he been so culpable, after all?  Why had
Monsieur de Pontivy filled his heart with hate and
rancour by refusing him her hand and turning him
out like a lackey?  On account of a difference of
caste?  Well, from this prejudice had sprung the
Revolution which had levelled all under the knife of
the guillotine!  That sad past, the terrible present,
were both due to the pride of Clarisse's father.
For he would not have thrown himself madly into
the turmoil....
</p>

<p>
But Clarisse again interrupted him.  The past
was dead now, quite dead!
</p>

<p>
"No," he cried, "the past is not dead, since
your son is here, the living proof of what has
been..."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"The punishment is mine, for if his hatred has
been a blow to your pride, causing you some transient
pain, it is I who must live out my life beside
that hatred.  Each time my son pronounces your
name with loathing and indignation, I can only ask
myself in terrified agony, if he will ever pardon me
for having given him a father such as you!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, thoroughly disheartened, looked at
her sadly.  "You also!" he exclaimed.  What! did
Clarisse share the general error?  Did not she
penetrate through the apparent violence of his policy
to the sublime end he had in view?  He sought to
explain his views to her, his notions for ensuring
the universal happiness of mankind; he depicted
the sacred ideal he dreamt of reaching by purging
France of all base and evil-minded traitors who
defiled her.  He an assassin!  He a tyrant!  No! he
was an avenger, an apostle of justice and virtue!
He was not responsible for the excesses of a nation
who had been enslaved for centuries, and had
suddenly cast off their chains.  Every conquest was
of necessity accompanied by carnage, every
revolution left the stains of blood behind!
</p>

<p>
Clarisse contemplated him with the same astonishment
Vaughan had experienced in the forest of
Montmorency, when Robespierre had unfolded to
the Englishman his projects and visions of universal
happiness, which could only be realised by the help
of the guillotine.
</p>

<p>
"The future will justify me!" he continued.
"When I am in power my deeds will convince you."
</p>

<p>
"But are you not all-powerful now?" Clarisse
exclaimed in spite of herself.
</p>

<p>
He showed her she was mistaken.  No, he was
not supreme!  Not yet!  Enemies barred his way;
but they were the last, and he was about to
overthrow them in one decisive contest!  Yes, he
yearned for that moment to come, for his strength
would not hold out much longer.
</p>

<p>
Then, lowering his voice, and trembling lest he
should be heard, he told her of the wretched life he
led; hunted down on all sides, hated, betrayed, his
every movement watched, a dagger ever hanging
over his head.  He spoke of his sleepless nights!
Oh! how he would hasten that last battle!  To
make the victory sure it would be as terrible as
possible; the whole horde of wretches who had
caused him such unspeakable torture should be
swept from his path!  Peace!  Peace! how glad he
should be to welcome it with open arms...
</p>

<p>
Clarisse listened in amazement to this wild tirade.
He had spoken of his haunted life, his sleepless
nights.  But were not these ever the lot of tyrants?
He sought forgetfulness, peace, a renewal of some
of the joys of life?  Then why did he not stay the
infamous proceedings of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, and throw wide the prison doors?  From
every breast would then resound a cry of deliverance
which would atone for all!  What greater happiness
for him, after causing so many tears than to dry
them again!  "Impossible! impossible!" answered
Robespierre.  Not yet!  He would have to pay for
it with his life like Danton!  The hour had not
yet come!  Clemency was treason, mercy meant
death.  In order to survive it was necessary to
denounce, accuse, strike, and slay remorselessly.
For it was the fear of death which prompted the
French to their most inhuman acts.  It influenced
every one, from the Convention, the Committees,
the Revolutionary Tribunal, to the very crowd who
had become the abject slaves of that terror which
held France in absolute subjection.  They had well
called this Government "the Terror."  Oh, yes! it
was a terror for the victims, for the accusers, for
the judges, a terror for all!
</p>

<p>
Clarisse looked at him, in bewilderment.  There
was no more hope, then?  France was to perish
under that rule of abject cowardice?  Would no
one take this evil by the throat and strangle it?
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"But who, my God! who?"
</p>

<p>
"I!"
</p>

<p>
"You?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I myself!"
</p>

<p>
And Robespierre unfolded his plans.  When
once the Committee of Public Safety had perished
on the scaffold he would be master, a master strong
enough perhaps to do away with the executioner
and to decree clemency!  When would that day
come?  He could not tell yet!  Perhaps in a few
days!  For the moment it was the vigil of arms.
Nothing was now possible but patience?
</p>

<p>
Clarisse was listening to a far-off sound which
reached them like the muffled roar of distant waves.
What was that noise?
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had heard it also and started up pale
and nervous.
</p>

<p>
It was the crowd greeting fresh cartloads of
condemned, which were passing the Place de la Grêve.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse groaned; she understood!  The death
on the scaffold, the last ride of those condemned by
the Revolutionary Tribunal!  Lebas had warned
her; it was just the time!  The tumbrils would pass
there, in that street, under these very windows!
Robespierre hastened to close the shutters.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, completely unnerved, gave way to grief
and despair.  So, all those people were doomed to
die, because the hour of mercy had not yet come!
In a few days, Robespierre had said it himself, in a
few days they might be saved!  The unfortunate
victims must die on the very eve of deliverance!
Oh, it was horrible!  horrible!  horrible!
</p>

<p>
"What can be done?  I am powerless," repeated
the Incorruptible.
</p>

<p>
What! he could do nothing?  Could he not now,
at this moment, do what he thought to do in three
days' time?  Could he not call out from the window
to the mob, the long-yearned-for-cry, "Mercy! oh,
have mercy!"  He had but to call these words out
to the crowd whose idol he was, and it would be an
atonement for all his life.  "Mercy!" and he was
a hero, a savior!  "Mercy!" and his son would
no longer have the right to hate him, and to curse
his name!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was grieved and distressed beyond
measure.  Clarisse did not know what she was
saying!  How could he stop the tumbrils, arrest
that crowd, composed of the very scum of the
nation?  Why, there was not one self-respecting
man among them!  Nothing but a mob mad with
the lust of blood.  The only power they feared or
respected was the Terror&mdash;the Scaffold!  He,
Robespierre, their idol?  Nay, he was not!  Their
idol was the executioner!  To fight single-handed
against such a besotted, blinded rabble would be
madness, sheer madness!
</p>

<p>
Clarisse paid no heed, but continued supplicating
him with uplifted hands, deaf to all argument.
</p>

<p>
The tumult of the mob, which sounded nearer,
causing the very sashes to shake, announced the
approach of the tumbrils.  Robespierre, drawn in
spite of himself to the window, partly opened the
shutters to look out, followed by Clarisse who
stopped as the hubbub of the crowd grew suddenly
louder, and uttered a stifled cry&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Here they are!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre closed the shutters again.  Tears
started to Clarisse's eyes.  She appealed to the
kindly qualities of his youth.  She had known him
ever compassionate and generous.  He had but to
call to mind how he had revolted against injustice,
how solicitous he had ever been for the weak and
oppressed.  Think of that time!  Think of it! and
all the spirit of her youth rose to her lips in
that cry of pity for the innocent victims of misrule.
Yes, innocent!  They were innocent!  And he
refused to save them!
</p>

<p>
"Once more I tell you it is madness," Robespierre
groaned in despair.  Would she not understand,
it was his death she was crying out for, her
own death too, and the death of her niece?  He
had only to attempt to save those unhappy victims,
and the crowd would at once turn upon him with
the fury of wild beasts!  He would be accused of
treason by the <i>sans-culottes</i>, and the fishwives
dancing yonder under the windows and howling the
<i>Carmagnole</i>!  He would be cut to pieces by the
swords of the prison escort, crushed under the
cartwheels, and cast into the gutter by the rabble for
having dared to arrest the reign of Terror!  Was
that what Clarisse wanted?  Or would she perhaps
allow him to live still to be able to save her, to save
her niece and her son?
</p>

<p>
The entrance door was pushed open.  Robespierre
turned, and seeing Urbain understood that
Lebas had at last arrived with Olivier.  He did not,
however, wish to be seen by his son.
</p>

<p>
"Let Citoyen Lebas and his companion wait outside
till I have gone," he said.
</p>

<p>
Urbain looked astonished.
</p>

<p>
"But there is no one with Citoyen Lebas," he replied.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse started up.
</p>

<p>
"What! no one?" asked Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"And Olivier?" Clarisse said in a low voice,
trembling with suspense.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre moved towards the door and called
anxiously to Lebas.  The day was fast closing, the
setting sun, peering in through the half-open shutters,
shed a crimson light in the apartment, staining here
and there in patches and streaks the furniture and
curtains with the hue of blood.
</p>

<p>
Lebas came in alone.
</p>

<p>
Olivier was no longer at the prison of La Force!
</p>

<p>
"Escaped?" asked Robespierre breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately not!" said Lebas, "but taken
by Coulongeon, the police-agent, by order of the
Committee of Public Safety, to ... Where?  No
one could tell!  To the Conciergerie perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
"Before the Tribunal!" Clarisse almost screamed.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was stunned.  The wretched members
of the Committee had placed Olivier on trial!
He had been, perhaps, condemned, and might even
now be on the road to the scaffold, in one of those
approaching tumbrils.  He cried breathlessly to
Lebas&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, quick!  Go down and see!"
</p>

<p>
Lebas rushed off, and Robespierre ran to the
window, Clarisse in mad despair following him.
</p>

<p>
"If he is ... you will, you must, cry out to the
people that he is your son!"
</p>

<p>
Alas!  Could he?  The populace would answer
that his son was a <i>Chouan</i>! that he might thank the
Tribunal for freeing him from such disgrace.
</p>

<p>
Thérèse, drawn from the bedroom by the deafening
cries of the crowd, now entered, trembling with
fear.  The carts were there...  She could hear
them!
</p>

<p>
"Mamma! mamma! do you hear?"
</p>

<p>
She stopped at sight of Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"The friend who saved us," said Clarisse,
answering her look of surprise.
</p>

<p>
Thérèse went straight to the window, but Clarisse
barred the way.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no! she must not look at such a spectacle.
Better kneel down and pray....  Pray for those
about to die and for them also, yes for themselves,
with all her soul!"
</p>

<p>
Thérèse fell on her knees and joined her hands,
her large blue eyes, brimful of tears, lifted towards
Saint Gervais, the deserted church, where the
lingering spirit of outraged religion might perhaps
accomplish a miracle!
</p>

<p>
The terrible tumult now burst on their ears like
the rumble of thunder.  As it drew nearer, separate
sounds were distinguishable; screams, ribald laughter,
hooting, degrading clamour, and coarse jokes
reached them; all the hatred and fury of the
Parisian populace was manifest in those hideous revels.
The crowd was ushering the first tumbril into the
Rue du Martroy, preceded by the mænads of the
guillotine, loathsome, drinkbesotted viragoes, who
yelled, and contorted themselves, dancing the
<i>Carmagnole</i> in front of the condemned.  Discordant
strains of revolutionary songs rose above the
rumbling of the cart-wheels, the clank of horses' hoofs,
and the cracking of whips.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had half opened the shutters, and
tried to distinguish the first cart through the dense
crowd.  Clarisse struggled with him to look also,
but the Incorruptible held her back resolutely.
</p>

<p>
"No; I will look alone!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you see him?  Tell me; is he there?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied, still preventing her from
approaching.
</p>

<p>
Then, as Robespierre made an eager movement,
she gasped in her agony&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He is there; I know it!" and again she struggled
to reach the window.
</p>

<p>
"I swear to you he is not there!" and
exhausted he quitted hold of her to wipe his brow.
</p>

<p>
The first tumbril had passed.  The songs and
cries of the mob surrounding it were lost in distance,
and these muffled sounds were mingled with the
murmurs of the crowd awaiting the other tumbrils.
Olivier was not in the first.  But the second?  He
was perhaps in the second?
</p>

<p>
Clarisse would have cried out in her despair, but
she struggled against the mad impulse and suppressed
her choking sobs lest she should reveal the awful
truth to Thérèse, who, still on her knees, her eyes
turned to the desecrated church, prayed aloud:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Our Father Which art in Heaven; hallowed be
Thy name; Thy Kingdom come; Thy will be done....</i>"
</p>

<p>
But she was interrupted by another outburst from
the mob announcing the second tumbril.  Already
scraps of the furies' songs reached her from the
distance:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Dansons la Carmagnole!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vive le son<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vive le son<br>
  Dansons la Carmagnole<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vive le son<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du canon!...</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Clarisse, taking advantage in a moment of
Robespierre's relaxed vigilance, pressed nearer to the
windows.
</p>

<p>
"The second cartload!"
</p>

<p>
"There are two of them," said Robespierre, who,
taller than she, could command a more distant view.
</p>

<p>
Two! two carts!  It was impossible for Olivier
not to be in one of them.  Clarisse felt it!  He
must be there!
</p>

<p>
"He is there, I feel it....  I tell you he is there!"
</p>

<p>
In her anxiety to see better she grew regardless
of precaution.  Robespierre struggled to draw her
from the window.  It was madness.  She might be seen!
</p>

<p>
Thérèse still raised her voice, choked with tears,
in supplications to heaven:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now, and at the hour of our death.  Amen!</i>"
</p>

<p>
A cry of anguish rent the air.  Clarisse had
recognised Olivier!  "There in that cart!"  Robespierre
strained his eyes, half dead with fear....
"Where?  Where?"  He could not see him!
"Oh yes!  Yes! there, in the second cart!  That
young man standing, his head bent!..."  And
unable longer to contain herself, in the madness of
grief, she placed her hand on the window clasp and
would have opened it; but Robespierre prevented
her, and the struggle began again.  No! she was
mistaken!  She need only look!  The young man
was raising his head.
</p>

<p>
"There, you see, it is not he!"
</p>

<p>
"Then he must be in another cart!..."  And
worn out with agonising suspense and excitement
she sank down in a chair.  Again the noisy clamour
died into the distance.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre took courage now.  It was surely the
last cartload!
</p>

<p>
"You look!" cried Clarisse....  "I cannot
look again!"
</p>

<p>
Oh! if it were the last!  If it were the last and
their torture at an end!
</p>

<p>
She leant her head on her hands and closed her
eyes, in order to see no more, while great silent tears
trickled through her fingers.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre lifted the shutters and stopped to look
through, but quickly let them fall again.  Alas!  It
was not over!  There was still another tumbril.
The buzz of sounds advancing gradually betokened
it too well!
</p>

<p>
In one bound Clarisse was at the window.
</p>

<p>
"Will it never end!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre made a gesture to close her mouth.
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, do not scream!"
</p>

<p>
But Clarisse did not heed him; she would go
out!  Out, into the street!  It was too awful!
She would put an end to it all!  Robespierre held
her back with fresh entreaties.  Maddened by the
restraint, she struggled desperately to free herself.
</p>

<p>
Thérèse, distracted from her orisons by the
violence of the scene, turned her head.  Seeing
Clarisse's state, she understood all in a moment.
Olivier was there in one of those tumbrils!  Olivier
was on the way to the scaffold! ... And Clarisse,
now regardless of consequences, owned the truth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, Olivier, our Olivier, he is there!  They
are going to kill him!..."
</p>

<p>
"Olivier! kill him!" repeated Thérèse, half
dazed; then the awful reality rushed suddenly upon
her.  She started to her feet with a cry that echoed
through the house.
</p>

<p>
"Olivier going to die?  Oh! mamma, mamma!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre continued his supplications, holding
Clarisse, who still struggled, in his grasp.  She
would have her son!  She would go and demand
him from the executioner!  Every mother there
would intercede for her!
</p>

<p>
"If they will not give him to me, let them kill
me, kill me with him!  I will go!  I will go!  I
must save my son!  For God's sake, let me go!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre implored Thérèse to help him hold
Clarisse back.  The young girl, realising the madness
of the act, appealed also to her aunt, speaking
words of consolation and of hope.
</p>

<p>
But her voice was drowned in the roar of the
mob, that rose and beat against the window-panes
like the waves of an angry sea.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!</i>"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
howled the Mænads, flinging their fearful watch-word
on the wind, heralding the dreadful spectacle
of advancing doom, dancing a veritable dance of
death.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Ah!  Ça ira, ça ira, ça ira,<br>
  Les aristocrats à la lanterne;<br>
  Ah!  Ça ira, ça ira, ça ira,<br>
  Let aristocrats on les pendra.</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Clarisse had now freed herself, and ran to the
door to open it.  But Robespierre, quick as thought,
stood before her and barred the way.
</p>

<p>
"Remain where you are, I charge you!"
</p>

<p>
Then resolutely and solemnly he added&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I myself will go!  And if he is in that cart,
I will brave all to save him!"  Seeing that Clarisse
seemed doubtful, he added with emphasis&mdash;"I
swear it to you!"
</p>

<p>
A flood of tears, tears of gratitude, was Clarisse's
only answer.
</p>

<p>
"May you be forgiven all for those brave
words!" she sobbed.
</p>

<p>
He led her to a chair near the window, and in a
state of exhaustion she allowed herself to be seated.
Thérèse bending over her forgot her own tears, in
drying those of Clarisse.  Robespierre, drawn to the
window by a fresh outburst in the street, turned and
looked out.  There was but one more cart now!
The prison escort followed in the rear.  It was
indeed the last!
</p>

<p>
The last!  It was the last cartload!  If Olivier
was not there, he was saved!  But he must be!
Alas, he must; where else could he be?  Struggling
between hope and fear, Clarisse fell on her knees,
and with clasped hands prayed aloud.
</p>

<p>
"O Lord, my God! my God!  God of mercy
and compassion, grant that my child may not be
there!"
</p>

<p>
Thérèse had also fallen on her knees beside
Clarisse, so that the two now knelt, locked in each
other's arms, and prayers and supplications rose from
both their lips.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!</i>"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
howled the mob.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, my God, have pity on us!" repeated the women.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, livid to the lips, continued his
agonising watch.
</p>

<p>
Growing anxious at the silence of the Incorruptible,
Clarisse would have risen, but her strength
failed her, and she sank down again on her knees,
her eyes fixed on Olivier's father, trying to read in
his drawn features evidence of his hopes or fears.
Thérèse joined her in this mute questioning.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was alternately raising himself, bending
aside, or stooping lower to see more plainly.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he gave an exultant cry&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He is not there!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure?  Are you sure?" gasped Clarisse,
trying to rise.
</p>

<p>
Thérèse, more easily convinced, kissed the poor
mother in a burst of joy.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure?  Are you sure, though?" repeated
Clarisse in a fainting voice.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre to convince her came and raised her,
and supporting her in his arms, carried her to the
window.
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe me now?" he said.
</p>

<p>
It was true.  There were only women in the cart.
</p>

<p>
"Only women!  My God, what a relief!"
exclaimed Clarisse leaving the window.
</p>

<p>
But she suddenly realised that her mother's heart
had made her selfish and inhuman, and with joined
hands she implored pardon of those unfortunate
victims.  She had fallen on her knees again, her head
on the back of a chair, thoroughly prostrate with
exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was now preoccupied with thoughts
of Olivier.  He was not in the tumbrils!  Where
was he, then?
</p>

<p>
Confiding Clarisse to the young girl's care, he
took his hat to go.
</p>

<p>
"Whoever you are, sir, may God bless you!"
said Thérèse with a long look of gratitude.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre turned and looked earnestly at her.
He tried to speak, but his voice failed him.  Feeling
his eyes fill with tears, he hurried from the room.
</p>

<p>
Vague, far-away murmurs came to them from
the distance, then ceased entirely, while the belfry
clock of Saint Gervais struck six.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
"ALL THESE GLIDING GHOSTS"
</h3>

<p>
On the stairs Robespierre met Urbain who was
just coming up.
</p>

<p>
"Quick! fetch me a hackney-coach!" he called.
</p>

<p>
The man turned and hurried down the stairs two
steps at a time.  A fiacre was crossing the street,
crawling as if waiting for a fare, and the driver
cynically inquired if he should take him to the scaffold.
</p>

<p>
"Place du Trône Renversé, <i>citoyen</i>?  The fun
hasn't commenced yet!"
</p>

<p>
Urbain opened the door while Robespierre gave
the address: "To the Committee of Public
Safety! and make haste!"
</p>

<p>
He then threw himself back in the carriage, which
turned round, and rolled rapidly in the direction of
the Tuileries.  The Incorruptible would soon have
the key to the mystery!  The police-agent of the
Committee, Coulongeau, could tell him at once
where to find Olivier.  He would wring the secret
from him by force if necessary!
</p>

<p>
When he arrived at the Tuileries, Robespierre
looked vainly for the police-agent; he wandered
from room to room, questioning every one he met,
putting the whole official staff at their wits' end,
but no Coulongeau was to be found.
</p>

<p>
The absence of the police-agent confirmed Robespierre's
suspicions.  Olivier must then be at the
Conciergerie under guard.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I can be there in time!" he thought, and
leaving the Tuileries, he went home to supper at the
Duplays.
</p>

<p>
It was now seven.  The family, who had waited
supper for Robespierre and Lebas, were growing
anxious, as they knew that the sitting of the
Convention had been long finished.  Duplay, who had
just returned from the Revolutionary Tribunal, took
an optimistic view of things.  The sitting had been
certainly a failure for Robespierre, but he was not a
man to be trifled with!  He would promptly retaliate,
and assuredly the meeting at the Jacobin Club that
evening would turn the tables upon his foes.  The
women with one consent decided to attend, feeling
it was but right to show their sympathy, though
Duplay raised a few feeble objections, mainly as a
matter of form.
</p>

<p>
"But since you are so sure we shall be victorious,"
urged little Maurice ingenuously, "what do
we risk?"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre appeared at that moment, his face
drawn and haggard.  He tried, however, to smile
as if nothing were amiss before the family, and said,
in answer to inquiries for Lebas, "He will soon be
here; I saw him less than an hour ago."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"At the Hôtel de Ville."
</p>

<p>
They understood, of course.  Robespierre and
Lebas had been to assure themselves that the forces
of the Commune were in readiness in case some fresh
phase of affairs might force the Incorruptible to break
the bounds of the law; and when they proposed to
go with him to the Jacobin Club after supper he
seemed touched, and, feeling sure of success, was not
unwilling that his intimate friends should witness
his triumph.
</p>

<p>
The front door opened.  It was Lebas returning,
completely out of breath, from the Place du Trône.
After having assured himself that Olivier was not in
the tumbrils, he had gone, to be quite certain, to the
very foot of the scaffold.  The Incorruptible met
him with questioning looks.
</p>

<p>
"You can be at rest!  He is safe for to-day..."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," said Robespierre, "but have
you found out where he is?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Lebas.
</p>

<p>
"He can only be at the Conciergerie, then.  I
will go there this evening after the meeting at
the Jacobins."
</p>

<p>
Supper was soon over.  Robespierre wished to
be at the Jacobins at eight o'clock, at the very
beginning of the sitting, for fear of being taken
unawares by the Committee, who were capable of
anything.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure my worst enemies will be there," he
muttered to Duplay, who assured him to the
contrary, as the family started along the Rue
Sainte-Honoré in anxious groups.  The Incorruptible
walked ahead, at some distance from them; Cornélie
noticed in astonishment that he did not offer
her his arm as usual, and said so to Lebas, who,
forcing a smile, answered, "He is so preoccupied
just now!"
</p>

<p>
Cornélie tossed her head.  It was not the first
time she had accompanied him to the Jacobin Club
in times of anxiety, and on those days he was most
attentive, and seemed to feel in special need of
sympathy.  Lebas did not reply, thinking of Clarisse
and Olivier, whilst Cornélie continued her threnody
of woes.  Robespierre was a few paces in front of
her, walking alone, and did not even turn to bestow
on her a single glance.
</p>

<p>
"Something is amiss," she said.  "I never saw
him thus before."
</p>

<p>
He was in fact thinking of Clarisse, of her joy
a few hours hence to have her son again, for
Robespierre would take Olivier from the Conciergerie
directly he was sure of his triumph at the
Jacobins; he thought also of this triumph, now so
certain, which would seem all the greater if Clarisse
could witness it.  She would see then how highly he
was esteemed, admired, and loved by all true, honest
Republicans, by all staunch soldiers of justice and
humanity.  Suddenly he stopped at the door of the
Jacobins, and went in without even turning to see
if any one was following.
</p>

<p>
This building, once the property of the monks of
St. James, had recently been turned by the
Revolutionists into a political club.  A powerful party
reigned there, exercising an occult influence on
the direction of public affairs and on the rulings of
the Convention, whom they terrorised by their
democratic arrogance and their violent, obstinate
fanaticism.
</p>

<p>
The meetings were held in a part of the building
formerly known as the convent-church, opening on
to a long gallery hung with portraits of monks, which
led to the ancient library.  At the lower end of this
assembly-room an altar was still standing, stripped
of all its ornaments and symbols of sacred services,
now forgotten in the hall where fierce fanatics,
breathing slaughter, hounded to death the victims
of the guillotine.
</p>

<p>
When empty, with its amphitheatre, its presidential
stand, its tribune, the room had the aspect of an
ordinary debating hall.  When full, it was a tribunal
of inquisition, the headquarters of terror and
of fear.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had become the ruling spirit of the
Club.  He was their lord-paramount, whose word
was absolute, and he was greeted on his appearance
by a thunder of applause.  The hall was filled with
an enthusiastic crowd, exasperated at the partial
defeat of their idol at the Tuileries.  Robespierre,
deeply touched, returned their salutations gratefully,
and re-read his speech prepared for the Convention,
interrupted at every point by loud approval.  In
order to stir their minds to the necessary pitch of
excitement, he spoke of this as his last testament, and
so induced another outburst of extravagant sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"I will die with you, Robespierre!" called out
one deputy.
</p>

<p>
"Your enemies are the enemies of the whole
nation!" cried another.  "Say the word, and they
shall no longer exist!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre looked at them with eyes full of
gratitude.  He was hoping that some one would
commence an attack, that he might retaliate there
and then, and so accentuate his triumph.  He had
perceived among the crowd his adversaries,
Billaud-Varennes and Collot d'Herbois.  They tried to
speak, and were hissed; they persisted, and were
greeted with cries of "To death with them!"  Daggers
even were drawn, and they had scarcely
time to escape.
</p>

<p>
The name of Robespierre was in every mouth
in that vast hall, acclaimed with cries of wild
approval that re-echoed to the very Tuileries.
</p>

<p>
The Duplay family, as may be imagined, beside
themselves with joy, waited for Robespierre outside,
but he was nowhere to be seen.  It was in vain
they inquired of every likely passer-by.  He had
completely disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the Assembly-room among the first he
had slipped out under cover of night, taking a short
cut to the Tuileries, whose dark mass aided his
further flight.  For he was flying from his glorification,
escaping from his rabid admirers, who would
have borne him in triumph through the streets of
sleeping Paris, making them ring with thunderous
shouts of triumph.  Creeping along the side of the
walls, his face muffled in his collar, he hastened his
steps to the Conciergerie, and as he walked his
thoughts reverted to the subject of his reception.
The Jacobins' enthusiasm must have resounded to
the chamber of the Committee of Public Safety,
and fallen like a thunderbolt among the traitors in
the very midst of their dark plots!  The effect
must have been terrible!  He already pictured the
Convention appealing to him with servile supplication,
delivering the Committee into his hands, and
asking the names of his enemies, that they might
pass sentence on them all.  He smiled triumphantly
as he crossed the Pont-Neuf, without casting a
glance at the splendid spectacle which lay at his
feet on either side of the bridge; for it was July,
and all the glory of a summer sky studded with
stars was mirrored in the stream.
</p>

<p>
He walked on quickly, wrapt in his own thoughts.
Ah! not only did they wish to ruin him, but they
would have sent Olivier to his death!  He had
forestalled them, however.  The very next day
they should take his son's vacant place in that same
Conciergerie, the antechamber of the guillotine!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had reached the quay, and was now
at the foot of the Silver Tower, whose pointed spire
stood out in the moonlight like a gigantic finger
raised to heaven.  It was in that tower that
Fouquier-Tinville, the Public Prosecutor of the
Revolutionary Tribunal&mdash;death's henchman&mdash;lived.
Robespierre scanned the windows.  All lights were
out.  Fouquier slept, then?  What brute insensibility!
But he would sleep also, he told himself.
Ah, yes! the terrors of the scaffold would soon be
over!  No more butchery, no more guillotine!
He had promised it to the mother of his son, and
he would keep his word ... he would, within
three days.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the side entrance of the Conciergerie,
he gave three knocks, and a grating was opened in
the door.
</p>

<p>
"It is I&mdash;Citoyen Robespierre."
</p>

<p>
The gate swung back on its hinges, and a voice
was heard exclaiming&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Salut et fraternité, citoyen!</i>"
</p>

<p>
It was Collas, the turnkey, on duty.
</p>

<p>
"I want Citoyen Fouquier-Tinville."
</p>

<p>
"He has not returned, <i>citoyen</i>."
</p>

<p>
Robespierre betrayed impatience.
</p>

<p>
"Can I do anything for you, <i>citoyen</i>?" said Collas.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to know if you have among your prisoners
a certain Germain, lately at La Force prison."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we can see that on the prison register,
<i>citoyen</i>.  Nothing will be easier, if the registrar is
still here.  Let me ascertain through the watchman.
Would you care to follow me?  Just wait a
moment; I have not the keys."
</p>

<p>
Collas went back into his lodge, and returned
with a bunch of keys.  Then, taking down a
lantern from the wall, he commenced threading the
mazy alleys of the Conciergerie, followed by the
Incorruptible.  It was the first time Robespierre
had entered this prison in which so many of his
victims had been immured.  The two men turned
into the old banqueting hall of the Kings of France,
a long gallery with a vaulted ceiling of oval arches
supported on massive pillars; keeping to the left,
they came upon an iron trellised gate, which the
turnkey opened.  Robespierre found himself in a
railed enclosure, a kind of antechamber leading to
another vaulted gallery, which in the dim light
seemed of indefinite length.  Two towering gates
on the left opened into a court on which the moon
shone, lighting up vividly a pile of buildings
surrounded with grey arcades.
</p>

<p>
As Robespierre and the turnkey advanced they
came upon a man sleeping in a chair, with a lantern
at his feet.  It was the night watchman.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, Barassin!" called the turnkey, shaking
his bunch of keys in his ears.
</p>

<p>
The man woke with a start.  At the mention of
Robespierre he rose in a tremor of fear at being
caught slumbering on duty.  He excused himself
profusely&mdash;he had been so hard-worked this last
month; there was no sleeping at all with the
cart-loads of prisoners coming at every moment.  Then,
with officious zeal, he invited Robespierre to
remain with him while Collas went to ascertain if
the registrar was still there, though this was very
unlikely at that late hour.  The turnkey went on
his errand.
</p>

<p>
"What part of the prison is this?" asked
Robespierre, looking around.
</p>

<p>
"We are between the two gates, <i>citoyen</i>.  Have
you never been to the Conciergerie before?"
</p>

<p>
"No; never."
</p>

<p>
Now was his chance!  Barassin had a subject to
interest the Incorruptible, and he launched forth
into a long description, overcrowded with details.
</p>

<p>
On the other side of that little door to the right
was the ward of the male prisoners.  Here at the
end was the women's courtyard, facing the arched
building in which were their cells.  Robespierre
had but to advance a little, and he could see through
the gate the fountain in which they washed their
linen, for they remained dainty to the last, and
wished to ascend the scaffold in spotless clothes.
Barassin laughed a loud brutish laugh, happy at
the seeming interest Robespierre took in his
explanations.
</p>

<p>
"Is the Recorder's office on the left, then?"
questioned the Incorruptible, his eyes fixed on the
dark gallery through which the turnkey had
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Barassin began another string of details.  Yes,
that gallery led to it, and to the exit as well,
through the concierge's lodge, where the condemned
had their hair cut after the roll-call.
</p>

<p>
"The call takes place here, just where you are
standing," he explained.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre started, and moved away.  His eyes
rested on the long line of cells, whose doors were
lost in long perspective under the vaulted archway
he had noticed on his entrance, and which had
seemed so vast through the iron bars of the second
gate.  He lowered his voice to ask if those cells
were occupied.  Barassin's reply reassured him;
there was no one there just then.  Then, indicating
a cell opposite Robespierre, the watchman continued,
carried away by his subject&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"This is the cell in which the Queen was locked up."
</p>

<p>
He opened a panel in the door that Robespierre
might glance within.  The Incorruptible hesitated at
first, and as he bent over resolutely to look, Barassin
found further material for his questionable wit:
</p>

<p>
"It's not such a palace as her Versailles, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre quickly closed the aperture, on the
outside of which he perceived a black cross.
</p>

<p>
"What! a cross?" he exclaimed, staring the
while at the sign of redemption.
</p>

<p>
The watchman told him that some prisoner had
probably daubed this cross on the panel after the
Queen's death.  The prisoners always stopped before
it to pray, and it was their habit to scribble in
that way over the prison walls with pencils, or even
nails.
</p>

<p>
"Why, here's your name!" he chuckled, highly amused.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"My name?"
</p>

<p>
Barassin raised his lantern, throwing the light on
an inscription in large letters on the wall, under
some prison notices.
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible read&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We shall be avenged, Robespierre, monster! your
turn will come!"
</p>

<p>
The watchman swung his lantern from place to
place, lighting up, for the Incorruptible's benefit,
other ominous inscriptions addressed to him.
</p>

<p>
"Robespierre, the tyrant!"
</p>

<p>
"Robespierre, the assassin!"
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible turned pale.
</p>

<p>
He was well accustomed to insult and abuse, no
doubt, but these imprecations on the walls, in that
gruesome and silent prison, seemed like the last curses
of the dead, written in letters of fire and blood!
</p>

<p>
"They must occupy themselves, I suppose!"
remarked Barassin, still laughing.
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible turned away, feeling ill at ease.
Again he questioned the man, fixing him the while
as if he would fathom the depths of his experience.
Did he keep watch every night?  He must have
witnessed some heart-rending scenes?  Was he
not disturbed in his sleep, living thus in continual
contact with the dread spectre of death?  Could he
really sleep?  Did not the cries of the victims
disturb his slumber?  Was he not haunted by their
solemn leavetakings and their sobs?
</p>

<p>
Citoyen Robespierre could rest assured!  Barassin
slept soundly enough!  Such fancies were very
well for women!  In the first place, the dead never
returned, and then, after all, it was not Barassin who
killed the victims, was it?
</p>

<p>
Steps were heard advancing, and the turnkey
made his reappearance.  The registrar had gone
away and taken the keys with him.  It was impossible
to get at the prison register.  He then suggested
that Robespierre should go with him to the
men's ward.
</p>

<p>
"Let us awake the prisoners.  If the man you
seek is there you will easily recognize him."
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible refused, starting involuntarily.
He had no wish to be seen by the prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Then, there was but one course left.  Barrassin
might accompany him, and speak to the men's
turnkey, who would look for this Germain from bed to
bed, and Barassin would bring back to Robespierre
the result of the inquiry, as he himself had to return
to his post.  Robespierre would have to wait a little
while, of course.  And Collas moved the watchman's
chair towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Very good!  I will wait, but be quick!"
</p>

<p>
The two men went away, turning to the left,
through the small gate, which Barassin carefully
closed behind him.  Robespierre followed the
watchman with his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Happy brute!  He can sleep in peace!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
So this man's sleep was not disturbed by such
horrible visions as haunted Robespierre!  But then,
as the watchman said, <i>he</i> had not killed the victims;
his name had not been inscribed on these walls as a
term and brand of infamy and hatred.
</p>

<p>
That writing on the wall seemed to be dancing
before his eyes.  "Robespierre, assassin; your turn
will come!"  So this was the cry which rose from
every breast!  If he was vanquished in the morrow's
struggle, if he had to ascend the scaffold without
having accomplished the act of social regeneration
of which he had so long dreamt, he would leave
behind him the execrated memory of a despot and
bloodthirsty tyrant!  His name would be coupled
with all the monsters of history!  Robespierre
would be cited by posterity side by side with Nero,
Caligula, Tiberius!
</p>

<p>
Stepping slowly towards the watchman's seat, he
sat down sideways, his eyes fixed, like a somnambulist's,
and his arm resting on the back of the chair,
as he repeated in a low murmur&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Your turn will come!"
</p>

<p>
Almost the same dread, ominous words had the
night before forced him to start up suddenly, and
impelled him to rush towards the window of his
room.
</p>

<p>
"Arise, Robespierre, arise?  Your hour has come!"
</p>

<p>
It was the shade of Camille Desmoulins that had
uttered the grim summons!  Camille, accompanied
by his wife, the pale and sweet Lucile, sought to
draw him to them, to drag him along with them on
the blood-strewn way to which they had been
doomed!  But the phantoms had all vanished with
the refreshing dawn.  It was fever, of course!
He was subject to it; it peopled his sleep with
harrowing visions and fearful dreams.  But these
were nothing but excited hallucinations, creatures
of his overwrought brain....
</p>

<p>
Robespierre had now closed his eyes, overcome
with fatigue, and still continued the thread of his
thoughts and fancies.  His ideas were becoming
confused.  He was vaguely wondering whether
such imaginings were due to fever after all?  If
this was not the case, it was perhaps his conscience
that awakened from its torpor, and rose at night to
confront him with his victims?  Yes, his conscience
that relentlessly gnawed at his heart-strings, and
wrung from him a gasping confession of alarm!
Had not Fouquier-Tinville seen the Seine one
night from his terrace rolling waves of blood?
This was also a mere delusion ... the outcome
of remorse, perhaps?  Remorse?  Why?
Remorse for a just deed, for a work of redemption?
No!  It sprung rather from a diseased imagination
caused by an over-excited and over-active brain,
which, weakened by excess, clothed the simplest
objects with supernatural attributes.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre's eyes were now half-closed, and
wandered dreamily to the women's courtyard, where
grey arches stood out in clear and sharp relief under
the soft moonlight.  He was in deep reverie,
wondering what could be the true cause of such
strange illusions, and as he wondered, examples from
past history came crowding to his mind.
</p>

<p>
Yes ... did not Brutus imagine that he saw
the shade of Cæsar gliding into his tent, when it
could have been nothing but the flicker of a lamp
on the curtains moved by the wind, or a moonbeam
playing, as that one yonder, on a pillar?
</p>

<p>
As he gazed his eyes dilated in horror.  It was
no moonbeam.  The outlines of a woman's form,
ethereal and transparent, stood motionless against the
pillar.  It moved!  Another form, white and
shadowy, glided towards the first, and a third
emerged from the dim background and joined them.
Robespierre followed every movement with
horror-stricken gaze.  He rose, crept nearer: was he
awake, or was it indeed a dream?  Had he again
fallen a prey to delusions at the very moment when
he was persuading himself of their unreality?  He
was not asleep!  He was wide awake!  He felt
the hot blood coursing through his veins, he walked
to and fro, and was completely self-possessed!
He knew he was at the Conciergerie, and had come
to fetch his son Olivier.  A little while ago he had
conversed with two men there, on that very spot,
the turnkey and the night watchman.  And yet his
nervous imagination conjured up before his eyes
those chimerical visions clothed with the semblance
of reality!  For, of course, he was not deceived, he
knew well enough they were unreal delusions, and
yet he felt nervous and ill at ease!
</p>

<p>
"What strange beings we are!" he thought.
"Poor human nature!  We pride ourselves on our
strength of mind, and yet we are subject to such
hallucinations!"
</p>

<p>
Again he was startled from his musings.  Other
forms suddenly appeared in the white moonlit courtyard,
walking slowly up and down, in pairs, singly,
or in groups.  They came and went, stopped,
conversed with or took leave of each other, all
in a great hush, without seeming to notice the
Incorruptible, who in his fear kept as much as
possible aloof, never moving his eyes from them
a moment.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, he uttered a cry.  He had bent forward
to examine their features and had recognised
... Madame Roland! ... Madame Roland! ... and
Madame Elizabeth, the king's sister; ... Good
God! and there was Charlotte Corday, the girl who
had killed Marat!  The courtyard filled with new
forms, blanched and wan, gliding about with
supernatural grace in the pale moonlight.  Robespierre
stood rooted to the spot, seized with wild terror.
</p>

<p>
"Am I mad?" he asked himself.
</p>

<p>
Ghosts!  Yes, they were ghosts!  What! was
he going to believe in ghosts, like old women and
children?  It was folly, crass folly, and he
repeated aloud&mdash;"Madness! sheer madness!"
</p>

<p>
But what did it all mean!  What were those
wandering forms which reminded him of beings
long dead?  Were they subtle effluences of their
bodies that could pass through the prison walls,
invisible by day, but luminous at night, as
phosphorescent spectres were said to flit among
tombstones in churchyards by moonlight, to the dismay
of the weak and credulous.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the weak and credulous!" he repeated,
in a voice which quavered none the less, "the
weak and credulous, easily prone to fear and
remorse..."
</p>

<p>
He went towards the gate of the men's ward
livid with fright, in the hope that the watchman
would come and put an end to these harrowing
phantasms.
</p>

<p>
He cried out in desperation&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Does the man never mean to come!"
</p>

<p>
At that moment a man's form appeared in the
gallery to his right, and he went towards it
hopefully.  Barassin?  But he recoiled.  No! it was
not he!  The form grew more distinct, others
followed.  There were now six, eight, ten, twenty
of them, a band of prisoners slowly and silently
moving towards the gate.  They were coming, all
coming!  He recognised them:
</p>

<p>
"The Girondins! .. Brissot! .. Vergniaud! .."
</p>

<p>
Were all his victims then going to show themselves
behind those iron bars like avengers, to torture
and madden him?
</p>

<p>
Robespierre was suddenly dazzled by a stream of
moonlight illuminating an iron grating just above
him, which he had not noticed on his entrance.
Outlines of fresh forms appeared behind the bars,
gradually growing more distinct.  They were the
ghosts of other victims!  For he recognised them,
while they, apparently, were unconscious of his
presence.
</p>

<p>
He took his eyes off these for a moment to see if
the spectres gathered behind the grating of the
ground floor were still there.  Yes!  They were
still there.  They were everywhere then?
Everywhere! ... What were they doing?  Why did they
come and force the past upon him in this way?
After spending the day in struggling with the living,
must his nights be spent in encounters with the dead?
He continued staring in mute and fascinated horror,
as motionless as those ghosts gathered behind the
closed grill, and seeming to await the gruesome
roll-call of the condemned.
</p>

<p>
At their silence he presently took heart.  None of
them had their eyes fixed on him.  This was proof,
he thought, that they existed only in his imagination.
For, after all, if they were real, they would have
stared at him in anger, with terrible and threatening
looks ... they would have rushed upon him, one
and all.  Those iron barriers would have yielded to
their united effort, and burst asunder!
</p>

<p>
Even as he thought this the gratings swung back
noiselessly.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre recoiled, his flesh creeping, cold beads
of perspiration starting on his forehead.
</p>

<p>
The gates had opened!  It was all true then!
They were real!  The whole array of spectres was
coming down upon him!  They were advancing
slowly, they were entering the courtyard!  No,
they had not seen him!  Robespierre was still
retreating, step by step.
</p>

<p>
"They haven't seen me!" he gasped.  If he
could gain the passage to the left of the archway,
which was the only exit available, he was safe!  He
would escape them!  For they were not likely to
follow him into the street....
</p>

<p>
He reached the vaulted passage, stepping
cautiously backwards, keeping them in sight all the
while, like a criminal in dread of detection.  But
at the entrance of the passage Danton and Camille
Desmoulins confronted him.
</p>

<p>
"Danton!  Camille!"
</p>

<p>
He started back, shaking with fear.  Every exit
was barred!
</p>

<p>
These two noted victims were advancing carelessly,
conversing together.  They had not noticed
him either!
</p>

<p>
The door of the Queen's cell now moved.
</p>

<p>
What! was that going to open too?
</p>

<p>
Marie Antoinette appeared on the threshold,
descended the few steps and joined the others, who
all made deep obeisance at the approach of their
sovereign.
</p>

<p>
The Queen! it was indeed the Queen!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre felt now that he was lost.  Flight had
become impossible.  The one remaining means of
escape was by the little grating of the men's courtyard.
He tried to reach it, still walking backwards,
without once losing sight of the apparitions, his
arms stretched behind him, every muscle strained,
and both hands clenched convulsively.  He soon
came in contact with the grating, and tried to push
it open with his back.  Not succeeding he abruptly
turned round.  It was locked!  He tried madly to
force it, but the massive iron bars proved too much
for his strength.  He seized and shook the lattice
in his agony.  The rattling noise made him turn
quickly, thinking all the spectres had come down
upon him.  But no!  They stood still in the same
places, motionless, and apparently unconscious of his
presence.  But this could not last; ... they must
see him sooner or later!  And if he were seen he
would surely be the prey of these arisen tenants of
the tomb!  He wiped the cold sweat from his brow,
panting and breathless, and made a sudden frantic
effort in his overwhelming panic to repel the ghastly
vision, turning away from it.
</p>

<p>
"It is absurd!  The dead never return!" he cried,
stamping violently.
</p>

<p>
He persuaded himself that it was only necessary
to disbelieve in it and the vision would fade, to
refuse to look, and he would no longer see the
phantoms.  He then turned round boldly, as if to prove
his words.
</p>

<p>
Every eye was upon him.  They appeared terrible
in the awful majesty of their wrongs, as if
accusing him, as if judging him.  He remained
motionless, terror-stricken.  Yes, they were all looking
at him!  Slowly, silently they glided towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no further! no further!" he cried.  "I
implore you!  I am frightened!..."
</p>

<p>
Every limb trembled, as he thus prayed them to
desist.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes!  I know what you are going to say, I
see the word trembling on your lips: 'Assassin!'"
</p>

<p>
The victims seemed to him to bend their heads
in mute assent.  He feared they would speak, and
hastened to prevent them....  Yes, he was an
assassin, he knew it! ... It was just and right
they should call him so!  He knew, yes, he knew,
what they wanted of him....  He must set free
the prisoners, overthrow the scaffold?
</p>

<p>
The victims again nodded approval.
</p>

<p>
Yes! ... Yes! ... he would do everything,
anything they asked.  He swore it to them....
</p>

<p>
"But in pity go!  I entreat you!  Oh go! in
pity, go and leave me!"
</p>

<p>
The spectres remained motionless, their eyes still
fixed upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!" he cried.  "Have mercy!"
</p>

<p>
Yes, mercy! ... he begged for mercy!  Their
looks would kill him!  He could not bear it any
longer!  It was too much!  His fright now
bordered on madness, and he cried out: "Let me
alone!  I am frightened!  horribly frightened!"
</p>

<p>
So saying he tottered forward, ready to drop from
exhaustion, and tried to grasp the back of the chair
for support.  But it gave way.
</p>

<p>
"Help! help!" he screamed.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo! who's calling?" cried a voice outside.
</p>

<p>
It was Barassin returning from the registrar's
office.  He opened the grating and entered, then
drew back in bewilderment at the sight of Robespierre
on the ground, his head buried in his hands.
The watchman at once thought that he must have
fallen asleep on the chair, and slipped on to the paved
courtyard.  He laid down his lantern, and tried to
raise the Incorruptible.  Robespierre awoke and
lifted his haggard eyes.  At sight of the man he
violently pushed him away.
</p>

<p>
"I see, you're not quite awake yet!" laughed Barassin.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre rubbed his eyes, and looked anxiously
around.
</p>

<p>
"You've had a dream? ... A nightmare, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" answered Robespierre, now himself
again.  "I have had a fearful dream."  Then
rising with difficulty, he fell exhausted on the
chair which the watchman held out to him.
</p>

<p>
Barassin now told Robespierre the result of his
quest.  They had interrogated the prisoners, from
bed to bed.  The young man he sought was not
among them.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, still uneasy, and casting anxious and
furtive glances in every corner, expressed his thanks.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he rose and seized Barassin by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Are we alone, here?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes!" answered the man in some surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Then let us go!" said Robespierre, impatiently,
"let us go at once!"
</p>

<p>
Barassin took his lantern, and walked in front.
</p>

<p>
"This way!" he said, opening the wicket through
which they had entered.
</p>

<p>
In the gallery Robespierre again seized the man's
arm, and bent forward to see if the way was clear;
then feeling immense relief, he rushed towards the
exit, almost running, and followed with difficulty by
Barassin, who with the lantern dangling in his hand
could scarcely keep pace with him.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  Citoyen Robespierre!" he panted,
"you're going too fast!"
</p>

<p>
But the Incorruptible continued his headlong
flight.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE EVE OF THE BATTLE
</h3>

<p>
Robespierre could breathe again.  He was once
more in the open, the silent stars above him, the
Seine flecked with white bars of reflected moonlight,
flowing at his feet.  But he dared not linger there.
He turned quickly, and darted along close to the
walls, fearing that for him, as once for
Fouquier-Tinville, the water would take the crimson hue of
blood.  By slow degrees he became calmer.  Refreshing
gusts of cool night air fanned his fevered
brow, and restored him to reality.  He thought of
Olivier again.  If he were not in the Conciergerie,
where could he be?
</p>

<p>
Entering the inner court of the Tuileries, at first
he seemed undecided, and then, as if under a sudden
impulse, went straight towards the Pavilion of
Liberty.  The Committee of Public Safety held its
meetings there, in the very apartment once
occupied by Louis XVI.  This committee usually
worked far into the night, and Robespierre was sure
of finding some one.  As he expected, he met
Billaud-Varennes and Collot d'Herbois, who were
crossing the vestibule of the ground floor at that
moment.  He accosted them angrily, for the two
men, who had been hissed and hooted at the Jacobin
Club, now seemed to exult, as though they held
some secret threat over his head.  The ironical
smiles he fancied he saw playing round their lips
aggravated his fury.
</p>

<p>
"So you have released the prisoner I sent to La
Force?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Quite true!" replied Billaud-Varennes, relishing
Robespierre's discomfiture as a set-off against the
Jacobins' hooting.
</p>

<p>
"For what reason?"
</p>

<p>
"To cross-examine him."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"That is for you to find out."
</p>

<p>
"I command you to send him back immediately
to La Force!"
</p>

<p>
"We receive no orders from you!"
</p>

<p>
"Then it is to be war between us?  You shall
have it, scoundrels! war to the knife!  And
to-morrow too!" and turning away abruptly, he
went towards the steps, and pushed the door open
in a violent rage.
</p>

<p>
Billaud-Varennes and Collot d'Herbois retraced
their steps to apprise their colleagues at the
Convention of their stormy interview with Robespierre.
But on the threshold of the Assembly-room Billaud
stopped his companion.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a moment," he said, "let me cross-examine
the young man first."
</p>

<p>
So saying, he went upstairs to the attics, where
Olivier had been locked up ever since five o'clock
under the charge of a gendarme, to whom Coulongeon,
the Committee's agent, had confided him,
with strict orders that the prisoner was to be kept
entirely out of sight until the Committee had decided
on his fate.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Coulongeon was one of the sharpest detectives
of the Committee.  It was he who, disguised as a
beggar, had been the object of Blount's sudden barks
in the forest of Montmorency, where he had
witnessed the interview between Robespierre and
Vaughan.  Driven away by Robespierre's agents,
he had gone immediately to the entrance of the
forest, expecting vainly the Englishman's reappearance.
</p>

<p>
On his return to Paris the same evening he had
reported his discovery at once to the Committee of
Public Safety.  Billaud-Varennes rubbed his hands
gleefully.  He was on the scent of a plot.  An
Englishman?  That could be no other than Vaughan,
Fox's agent, who was known to have been already
two days in Paris.  Ah!  Robespierre had secret
interviews with him, had he?  A plot, of course!
It was splendid!  Nothing could be more opportune!
</p>

<p>
"Run quickly, and ascertain if the Englishman is
still at the American Consulate, while we draw up
the warrant of arrest!" was his immediate order.
</p>

<p>
But at the Consulate the detective was told that
Vaughan had just left Paris.  Suspecting a trick,
he took other means to continue his inquiries, only
to find after all that the Englishman had started
for Geneva directly after leaving Montmorency.
</p>

<p>
The members of the Committee were greatly
disappointed on learning that the plot must remain
unravelled, for how could they prove the interview
without witnesses?  Coulongeon was the only one
who had seen Robespierre speaking with Vaughan,
but he was in the pay of the Committee, and no
one would believe him.  They rested their hopes
on the probable return of the Englishman, but they
waited to no purpose, and were finally obliged to
abandon the attempt.
</p>

<p>
One evening, however, Coulongeon had brought
the Committee an unlooked-for piece of news.
Having had a message to take to the prison of La
Bourbe, he had found himself in the Acacia courtyard
among the prisoners just at their supper-hour.
Two female prisoners had attracted his attention.
It seemed to him as if it was not the first time he
had seen them, and after searching his memory for a
moment, he recognised them as the two women
who were with Vaughan in the forest of Montmorency
before Robespierre arrived on the scene.
Yes, he remembered it all now!  It was so!  There
was not the slightest doubt!  The gaoler, when
questioned, completely confirmed his suspicions.
The women did come from Montmorency, where
they had been arrested by Robespierre's orders.
"Now we have two witnesses!" Billaud-Varennes
cried in delight.
</p>

<p>
"Three!" the agent interjected.  "For, now
I come to think of it, there was a young man
with them."
</p>

<p>
"He must be found also!  Quick to Montmorency,
and bring him back with you!"
</p>

<p>
At Montmorency, after two days of fruitless
search, the detective discovered Clarisse's house in
the forest.  The gardener on being interrogated replied
that he was completely ignorant of the whereabouts
of Olivier, who had disappeared the very day his
mother and his <i>fiancée</i> were arrested....  Perhaps
Leonard the locksmith could tell him.  Questioned
in his turn, Leonard replied evasively.  Coulongeon
then informed him who he was, and threatened him
with the law, so that Leonard ended by owning that
the young man had started the same night for Paris.
He swore that was all he knew.  Coulongeon,
pretending to be quite satisfied, thanked him and went
away.  But returning soon after he adroitly
questioned the neighbours on Leonard's connections and
acquaintances.  The agent learnt that when the
locksmith went to Paris he took up his abode in
furnished apartments in the Rue de Rocher, kept by
a certain widow Beaugrand.
</p>

<p>
"Now I am on the right track," thought Coulongeon.
</p>

<p>
Once back in Paris the agent had little difficulty
in making the good woman speak.  Did the widow
Beaugrand know the young man?  Pardieu!  She
knew him too well!  He was the daring insulter of
Robespierre, the young madman arrested on the
Fête of the Supreme Being who was now
imprisoned at La Force.
</p>

<p>
The joy of the Committee knew no bounds,
when they learnt the news on leaving the hall of the
Convention on the 8th Thermidor.
</p>

<p>
Billaud-Varennes, as can be imagined, was also
overjoyed.
</p>

<p>
"We will have the three prisoners out of gaol,
at once, and keep them here at hand."
</p>

<p>
Two orders of release had been immediately
drafted, one for the prison of La Bourbe, the other
for La Force.
</p>

<p>
Coulongeon had gone first of all to La Force to
fetch Olivier, whom he conducted straight to the
Tuileries and locked in a little chamber above the
Committee-room under charge of a gendarme.  But
at the prison of La Bourbe he was too late; the
two women had been taken away by Lebas, under
an order of release from Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
On his return the police-agent had sought Billaud-Varennes
to apprise him of the result of his errand,
but finding that he was away until after the meeting
of the Jacobins, he left a sealed note for him with
full particulars.
</p>

<p>
Billaud received this on his return from the
Jacobins accompanied by Collot d'Herbois.
</p>

<p>
"Out of three witnesses, only one is left to us!"
he exclaimed on reading it.  "The most important
one, however!  We have the man himself who
insulted the traitor!  We must cross-examine him
directly.  It will be amusing."
</p>

<p>
Robespierre just then appeared on the scene and
hastened the examination by his violent outburst.
</p>

<p>
Billaud-Varennes began to cross-examine Olivier
in the little chamber above the Committee-room.
The young man knew nothing of the plot.  Robespierre
might have had an interview with Vaughan
in the forest, this was very possible, but he, Olivier,
had left just after the Englishman's arrival.
</p>

<p>
"You spoke to him, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"To whom?"
</p>

<p>
"To Vaughan."
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes!  I exchanged a few words with him."
</p>

<p>
"You knew him, then?"
</p>

<p>
"My mother knew him.  He was an old friend of hers."
</p>

<p>
"She knew then what he came to Montmorency for?"
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least.  It was quite a chance-meeting.
He had lost his way, when they..."
</p>

<p>
"And you know absolutely nothing of what passed
after your departure?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, except that my mother and my <i>fiancée</i>
were arrested by Robespierre's infamous orders."
</p>

<p>
Billaud-Varennes left the room greatly disappointed.
He wondered if, after all, Olivier was
telling the truth.
</p>

<p>
"However, the young man has the night to
reflect over it," he said to himself, as he descended
the stair.  "I will question him again to-morrow
after having conferred with the Committee, perhaps
by that time he will have decided to speak!  And
yet I cannot but think he was sincere."
</p>

<p>
With this he re-entered the room where his
colleagues were assembled.  But such an extraordinary
scene of animation presented itself when he opened
the door that he forgot the object of his visit.
</p>

<p>
This Committee-room, like the others next to it,
formed part of a suite of apartments recently
belonging to the King.  It offered a strange spectacle,
with its mixture of elegance and vulgarity, which
said more than words for the ravages of the
Revolution.
</p>

<p>
Over the five doors, two of which opened on to
a long corridor, the royal arms surmounted by a
crown had been roughly erased.  The walls and
panels of the doors were covered with printed
decrees of the Convention, and tricolour placards were
pasted up everywhere.  This array of Revolutionary
literature struck the observer as at once ominous and
pathetic, in the midst of all the grace and beauty of
that white and gold reception-room, decorated in the
purest Louis XV. style, with its daintily carved
cornices and painted ceiling, where Nymphs and Cupids
sported in the glowing spring-tide among flowers.
The contrast was even more apparent in the furniture.
Gilded armchairs covered with rare tapestry,
now all torn, stood side by side with plain deal
seats, some of which were very rickety.  A sideboard
laden with eatables and wine-bottles completed
the installation of the Terror in the palace of the
Tuileries.
</p>

<p>
Billaud-Varennes was still standing there on the
threshold.  Collot d'Herbois, surrounded by Barère,
Carnot, Prieur, and Elie Lacoste, was violently
addressing Saint-Just, Robespierre's friend, who was
seated at the table, engaged in writing the speech
he was to deliver before the Convention on the
morrow.  Saint-Just, calm and contemptuous,
replied to their insults by a shrug of the shoulders.
This disdain exasperated Collot d'Herbois beyond
measure, and Saint-Just aggravated him still more by
ironical inquiries about the Jacobins' meeting.
</p>

<p>
"You are nothing more than a traitor!" cried
Collot; "it is our indictment you are drawing up
there, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, traitor! threefold traitor!" exclaimed Elie
Lacoste.  "Traitor and perjurer, you form with
Robespierre and Couthon a triumvirate of
calumny, falsehood, and betrayal."
</p>

<p>
Saint-Just, without losing self-possession a moment,
stopped in his writing, and coldly offered to
read them his speech.
</p>

<p>
Barère disdainfully refused to listen.
</p>

<p>
"We fear neither you nor your accomplices!
You are but a child, Couthon a miserable cripple,
and as to Robespierre..."
</p>

<p>
At this moment an usher brought in a letter to
Barère.  He looked uneasy after he had read it, and
signed to his colleagues to follow, leaving Saint-Just
free to continue his work.  In the lobby Barère told
them it was a letter from Lecointre announcing the
approaching attack upon the Committee by the
troops of the Commune, and offering the battalion
of his section for their defence.
</p>

<p>
"It is exactly as I told you!" cried Elie Lacoste.
"The leaders of the Commune must be instantly
arrested, and with them Robespierre and his two
accomplices!"
</p>

<p>
"Commencing with Saint-Just and his speech,"
said Collot.
</p>

<p>
"Robespierre was here just now," observed
Billaud-Varennes, who had followed his colleagues
out of the room; "he wanted to know what we
had done with the prisoner from La Force.  We
told him we had not to render account to him,
whereupon he went away in a rage, crying out,
'You want war?  War you shall have then!'  We
have been warned by the Incorruptible himself, you
see!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but we shall crush him through his Englishman!
We have witnesses enough now!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, unhappily we have not!" replied Billaud.
</p>

<p>
"What! we have no witnesses?" exclaimed
Barère in surprise.  "What do you mean? ... Has
not Coulongeon...?"
</p>

<p>
"Coulongeon arrived too late at La Bourbe
Lebas had just taken them off, by Robespierre's
orders&mdash;no one knows whither."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! the villain! he suspected something, then,
and abducted them to suppress their evidence; but
we have at any rate the young man from La Force."
</p>

<p>
"He is upstairs, but he knows nothing."
</p>

<p>
"He lies, he is a traitor!"
</p>

<p>
"No, he seemed quite sincere, and he execrates
Robespierre; but I shall question him again to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"And meanwhile we must resort to stratagem,"
remarked Barère.
</p>

<p>
They discussed and debated the question, and
all came to the conclusion that Barère was right.
Their safety lay in stratagem.  After all, there was
no immediate peril.  Robespierre was not fond of
violent measures, he would not break the bounds of
the law unless driven to it.  It was out of sheer
vexation that he had thrown that challenge in
Billaud-Varennes' face; and after all, since Saint-Just
had again assured them of the Incorruptible's pure
intentions, it would be perhaps prudent to
dissemble and to disarm the triumvirate by simulating
confidence.
</p>

<p>
On the whole the members of the Committee
were undecided, hesitating between two alternatives,
one as dangerous as the other.  Either they must
openly attack Robespierre and overthrow him, and
thus add to the already unbounded power of the
Committee, which would then more easily crush the
Convention; or they must leave the power in
Robespierre's hands, who, when once master, would
lose no time in annihilating them.
</p>

<p>
The members returned to the Committee-room
where Saint-Just was still writing.  They spoke as
if they had altered their mind on thinking things
over.  They regretted their hasty words, for after
all the patriotism of Robespierre and his friends had
stood a long test.  They spoke of precautions to be
taken in case of an unexpected attack, for warnings
had reached them from every quarter.  All this was
discussed aloud before Saint-Just, ostensibly to show
their complete confidence in him.
</p>

<p>
Saint-Just, to all appearance the dupe of their
hypocrisy, assured them they were unnecessarily
alarmed.  If the Jacobins and the Commune had
formed any projects against the Committee, he
would have heard of it.  There was certainly
considerable excitement in the streets among the people
whose anger had been aroused at the calumnies to
which Robespierre had been subject.  But the
Incorruptible would soon calm them down.  As far
as he, Saint-Just, was concerned, he was ready to
forget the somewhat hasty words which one of his
colleagues had addressed to him in the heat of the
moment.
</p>

<p>
Collot d'Herbois upon a sign from Barère feigned
to regret his hasty speech, which was, of course, he
said, the outcome of excitement.  It was so easy in
these times of anger and enmity to be carried away
by the fever of the moment.  The dissensions of
the Committee were making them the laughing-stock
of their enemies.
</p>

<p>
Saint-Just, cold and impassive as before, quietly
assented, and meanwhile continued to draft his
speech, and when he had finished put it in his
pocket, and looked up at the clock.  It was five in
morning.
</p>

<p>
"At ten, the speech will be copied, and I shall
read it to you before the sitting, so that there may
be no unpleasantness," said Saint-Just, rising to go.
</p>

<p>
Taking his hat and stick, he moved off, the others,
to all appearance reassured, pretending to do
likewise; but Saint-Just had no sooner disappeared
than they returned to the Committee-room.  It was
agreed to send for the three leaders suspected of
assisting Robespierre in the insurrection: Hauriot,
the Commander of the troops; Payan, the Commune
agent; and Fleuriot-Lescot, Mayor of Paris.  The
ushers returned with the two last named, but Hauriot
was not to be found.  For the space of four hours
they retained Payan and Fleuriot-Lescot, smoking,
drinking, eating, talking, and discussing, in the sultry
and oppressive heat which heralded the near approach
of a storm.  They thus held them in check for the
time being, overwhelming them meanwhile with
questions, to which they replied in terms that tended
to calm the anxiety of the Committee.
</p>

<p>
During this time the Parisian populace, who had
not slept either, had entered the Convention, the
assembly-hall of which, situated also in the palace of
the Tuileries, within ear-shot of the Committee, had
been filling since five o'clock that morning, though
the sitting was not to commence until noon.
</p>

<p>
Every moment messengers arrived at the
Committee-room, ushers out of breath bringing news,
messages, and reports in an endless succession,
which increased as the hours advanced.  Payan and
Fleuriot-Lescot had just left, after completely
reassuring the Committee.  It was now half-past ten,
and the sitting was opened.  Saint-Just did not put
in an appearance, but the thump of crutches was
heard in the corridor, announcing the arrival of
Couthon, the cripple.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Saint-Just?"
</p>

<p>
"He is coming!"
</p>

<p>
For one hour Couthon kept the Committee in
suspense, entertaining them with Saint-Just's favourite
theme, Robespierre's single-minded patriotism,
but still no Saint-Just appeared.  The Committee
began to feel annoyed, and soon Carnot, who
suspected treachery, spoke out boldly.  It was nothing
less, he said, than a preconcerted plan between
Couthon, Saint-Just, and Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
Couthon protested.
</p>

<p>
"You do wrong to speak ill of the patriot
Robespierre!  You are basely calumniating a friend of
your childhood!"
</p>

<p>
"If I am base, you are a traitor!" retorted
Carnot, beside himself with rage.
</p>

<p>
But Couthon, anticipating a storm, took up his
crutches and stumped off, protesting as he went.
Sinister sounds now reached the Committee.  They
had been betrayed!  Saint-Just was going to
denounce them from the tribune!  The document
he had been drafting before them, there on that
table, was nothing more or less than the indictment
of the Committee!  Barère had just received
trustworthy information to that effect.  Robespierre
had drawn up a list of eighteen names of those
destined for the scaffold.  A deputy entered and
asked for Billaud-Varennes.  He was told that
Billaud had just gone out, but would return shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Here is Fouché!" some one exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
It was in truth Fouché, the deputy, who now
entered.  He was beset with questions.  Yes! they
were not mistaken, he told them.  Robespierre
was now going to throw off the mask, and
denounce some of his colleagues.  "And I am
sure he has not forgotten me," added Fouché,
ironically.
</p>

<p>
He was immediately surrounded by eager
questioners.  The names?  Did he know the names? they
asked anxiously.  Fouché did not know; but
everybody was threatened, and each must look after
himself; the sitting would soon begin.
</p>

<p>
All turned their eyes anxiously to the clock.  It
was not yet noon; they had still twelve minutes!
Now another deputy came in, breathless with the
news that Robespierre had just entered the Hall of
the Convention, with his brother Augustin, Couthon,
Saint-Just, Lebas, and all his followers.  The
galleries, crowded to excess, had received the
Incorruptible with loud cheers.
</p>

<p>
"Hark, the rabble are applauding; he has hired
his usual <i>claque</i>," said one.
</p>

<p>
"That's true," another answered.  "Since five
this morning the Robespierrists, male and female,
have taken possession of the galleries, yelling,
feasting, and drinking."
</p>

<p>
"They are already drunk."
</p>

<p>
"Well!  Let us go and offer our heads to the
drunkards!" exclaimed Fouché.
</p>

<p>
But just then a door on the right opened, and
Billaud-Varennes entered.  Every one paused.
</p>

<p>
"Here is Billaud at last."
</p>

<p>
Billaud was looking anxious, and wiping his
brow, worn out with the heat, he asked for a glass
of beer.  They eagerly questioned him.
</p>

<p>
"Was it true, then?  They would have to fight?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes! fight to the death.  They ought to have
listened to him.  Robespierre had told him plainly
enough that there would be war.  And now that
they could not prove the plot...."
</p>

<p>
"What plot?" asked Fouché.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes!  It's true; you don't know...."
</p>

<p>
Billaud made a sign to shut the doors, as Robespierre
had spies in all the corridors.  The doors
securely closed, Billaud-Varennes again told the
story of the Englishman.  Fouché listened with
curiosity.  Other members, Vadier, Amar, Voullaud,
who had just entered, also followed Billaud's story
with keen interest, while those who already knew of
the plot, came and went, deep in discussion, waiting
for Billaud to finish, to give their opinion.
</p>

<p>
Billaud-Varennes now produced the order of release
for the two women, signed by Robespierre, and
brought from the prison of La Bourbe by Coulongeon.
</p>

<p>
"There can be no doubt.  We have in this quite
enough to ruin him," said Fouché; "but what
about that young man from La Force?"
</p>

<p>
"I questioned him again closely just now in the
next room.  He persists in his first statement, which
appears to me quite genuine&mdash;as genuine as is his
rage against Robespierre, whom he regrets, he says,
not to have stabbed at the Fête of the Supreme
Being."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! if he had! what a riddance!" was the
cry with which one and all greeted Billaud's last
words.
</p>

<p>
"True; but he has not done it," observed
Fouché drily.  "As to the plot, it has escaped our
grasp."
</p>

<p>
"Not so," some one remarked; "his treason is
evident."
</p>

<p>
A warm discussion ensued.  The treachery was
obvious to the Committee, but it would not be so
in the eyes of the public.  It must be proved.
And where was the Englishman?  Where were
the women?  To accuse Robespierre thus, without
sufficient proof, was sheer folly.  The only
witness available, the agent Coulongeon, was in
the pay of the Committee.  Robespierre would
make a speech on it, call it a concocted plan, and
annihilate his accusers with an oratorical flourish.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing truer!" remarked another deputy.
</p>

<p>
"He has only to open his mouth and every one
trembles."
</p>

<p>
"Very well; let us gag him," said Fouché.
"It's the only means of putting an end to it all."
</p>

<p>
They looked at him, not quite catching his
meaning.  Fouché explained his idea.  They had but
to drown Robespierre's voice at the sitting by their
clamour.  They had but to howl, scream, vociferate;
the people in the galleries would protest
noisily, and their outcry would add to the tumult.
Robespierre would strain his voice in vain to be
heard above the uproar, and then fall back exhausted
and vanquished.
</p>

<p>
"That's it," they cried unanimously.
</p>

<p>
Billaud also thought this an excellent idea, and
at once began to arrange for letting all their friends
know as soon as possible, for Robespierre must be
prevented from uttering a single audible word.
Every one approved.  Just then a door opened.
</p>

<p>
"Be quick!  Saint-Just is ascending the
tribune!" called a voice.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  We may as well commence with him."
</p>

<p>
And they one and all made for the doors in an
indescribable disorder.
</p>

<p>
"Now for it," cried Billaud, laying his glass
down on the sideboard.
</p>

<p>
But meanwhile Fouché signed to Vadier, Amar, and
Voullaud to remain.  They looked at him in surprise.
Fouché waited for the noise to subside, then assuring
himself that no one could overhear him, he confided
his fears to them.  It was not everything to drown
Robespierre's voice.  Even arrested, condemned,
and on the death-tumbril, his hands bound, Robespierre
would still be dangerous; a sudden rush and
riot could deliver him, and crush them all!  Then
lowering his voice, he continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The young madman of whom Billaud spoke
just now...."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
Amar pointed to a door on the left.
</p>

<p>
"Let him come in!" said Fouché; "I will
speak to him in the name of the Committee."
</p>

<p>
They did not yet quite grasp his meaning, but
Voullaud went all the same and opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" said Fouché, "here is the young man!"
</p>

<p>
Olivier entered, followed by a gendarme, who, on
seeing Fouché and the other members, stopped on
the threshold.  Olivier looked at them indifferently,
expecting to be again cross-examined about the
Englishman.  Fouché had taken his hat and put it
on, as if going out.
</p>

<p>
"Young man, you were the first to charge the
despot, whom we are about to fight, with his crimes!
This is sufficient to recommend you to the
indulgence of the Committee."
</p>

<p>
As Olivier advanced in astonishment, he continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You may go if you like!"
</p>

<p>
Fouché turned to the gendarme&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The citoyen is free!"
</p>

<p>
The gendarme retired.
</p>

<p>
Vadier now understood Fouché's idea.  Taking
up his hat also, he remarked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And if our enemy is victorious, take care not to
fall again into his clutches!"
</p>

<p>
Olivier who was preparing to go, stopped suddenly.
Unhappily, he said, he had not only himself
to tremble for.  His mother and <i>fiancée</i> were in
prison and Robespierre would revenge himself on
them.
</p>

<p>
"Most probably!" replied Fouché.
</p>

<p>
"Then the Committee ought to release them
also, and with even more reason!"
</p>

<p>
Fouché shrugged his shoulders regretfully.
</p>

<p>
It had been the intention of the Committee, but
the two prisoners were beyond their reach.
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked Olivier anxiously.
</p>

<p>
Simply because they were no longer at the prison
of La Bourbe.
</p>

<p>
Olivier gasped&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Condemned?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet!  But Lebas had taken them away
with an order from Robespierre."
</p>

<p>
Here Fouché, picking up the order left on the
table by Billaud-Varennes, showed it to Olivier,
who read it in horrified amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Where are they then," he cried.
</p>

<p>
"At the Conciergerie, where they would be
judged within twenty-four hours."
</p>

<p>
"The wretch! the wretch!"
</p>

<p>
He implored them that they might be released.
The Committee were all-powerful!&mdash;They, powerful,
indeed?  They looked at him pityingly.  He
believed that?  What simplicity!  How could they
release the two women when they were on the
point of being sacrificed themselves?  They would
have difficulty enough to save their own heads!
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," continued Fouché, "we shall
most likely be with your mother, at the foot of
the scaffold."
</p>

<p>
Olivier looked at them in terror.  Was it
possible?  Was there no one that could be found to
kill this dangerous wild beast?
</p>

<p>
Fouché, who had consulted his colleagues in a
rapid glance, now felt the moment ripe.
</p>

<p>
"Assassinate him, you mean?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Olivier lost all self-control.  Is a mad dog
assassinated?  He is killed, that's all!  What did it
matter if the one who did it were torn to pieces;
he would have had his revenge, and would save
further victims.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said Fouché, "and if Robespierre
is victorious, it is the only chance of saving your
mother."
</p>

<p>
"But don't rely on that!" Vadier remarked.
</p>

<p>
Amar went even further.
</p>

<p>
"Patriots like Brutus are not often found!" he
said.
</p>

<p>
But Olivier cried out in his fury that only one
was wanted, and then looked about for the door.
</p>

<p>
"Which is the way out?"
</p>

<p>
Vadier pointed to the exit.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, citoyens! ... Adieu! au revoir!"
</p>

<p>
The four men silently watched him disappear,
and then looked at each other....  Would he do
it?  It was not impossible!
</p>

<p>
"Meanwhile, let us go and howl!" suggested Fouché.
</p>

<p>
And they rushed into the Convention-room.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
A BROKEN IDOL
</h3>

<p>
Saint-Just is in the tribune.  Collot d'Herbois
occupies the presidential chair, Collot who, at two
in the morning, suspecting Saint-Just's treachery,
had openly charged him with it.  War is in the air,
and every member is at his post.
</p>

<p>
Fouché looks round for Robespierre as he crosses
to his seat.  There he is; in the semicircle before
the bust of Brutus, at the foot of the tribune which
he seems to guard like a vigilant sentinel.
</p>

<p>
"He is dressed as he was at the Fête of the
Supreme Being," whispers Fouché ironically to his
neighbour.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the Incorruptible has on his sky-blue coat,
white-silk embroidered waistcoat, and nankeen
knee-breeches buttoned over white stockings, nor has he
omitted the powder and the curls.  What a strange
figure, with his dapper daintiness, his old-fashioned
attire, in that seething furnace of fifteen hundred
people, actors and spectators, so closely packed,
and, most of them with bared breasts, suffocating
in the awful heat which oppresses them!  The
<i>sans-culottes</i> up in the gallery have even taken off their
traditional red nightcaps, which they hang on
the handles of their sword-sticks like bloodstained
trophies.
</p>

<p>
It is as they expected.  Since five the hall has
been taken possession of by Robespierrists.  All the
worst scum of Paris has gathered there; all the
bloodhounds of the Revolution, all the riff-raff who
accompany the death-tumbrils to the scaffold to the
song of the <i>Carmagnole</i>; fish-wives and rowdies,
recruited and hired at twenty-four sous apiece to
drown with their vociferations every hostile attempt
made against the idol of the Commune.
</p>

<p>
This brutish mob, reeking of sausages, pressed
meat, gingerbread and beer, eating and drinking,
poison the atmosphere of the Hall.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre's arrival at twelve o'clock is hailed
by repeated rounds of loud applause, which he
acknowledges with a gracious bow, proud and smiling.
Turning to Lebas who accompanies him, he remarks,
"Did I not tell you it would be a success?"
</p>

<p>
So certain is he of victory that before starting he
had set the Duplays quite at ease as to the issue of
the struggle.  "Believe me," he had said, "the
greater part of the Convention are unbiassed."
</p>

<p>
But suddenly, at the commencement of the sitting,
when Saint-Just appears in the tribune, a
counter movement makes itself felt in the assembly.
Robespierre realising the importance of at once
preventing any hostile demonstration, advances to the
foot of the tribune, determined to daunt his
opponents by a bold front.  Saint-Just at once renews
the accusation brought against the Committee by
the Incorruptible the day before, accentuating it
without mentioning names.
</p>

<p>
It is now that the anti-Robespierrist plot,
admirably planned, begins to work.
</p>

<p>
Tallien, one of the conspirators, breaks in upon
Saint-Just violently.
</p>

<p>
"Enough of these vague accusations!" he cries.
"The names!  Let us have the names!"
</p>

<p>
Saint-Just, encouraged by a look from Robespierre,
simply shrugs his shoulders, and continues.
But his voice is immediately drowned in a thundering
clamour, and in spite of the vehement protestations
of Robespierre, he is unable to finish his
speech.  The anti-Robespierrist cabal are playing
their part well.  They simply roar.
</p>

<p>
Billaud-Varennes demands a hearing.  He is
already in the tribune, greeted by sustained applause.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, growing excited, protests and persists
in speaking, but his voice is drowned in cries of
"Silence!  Silence!  Let Billaud-Varennes speak!"  Collot
d'Herbois rings the president's bell, and adds
to the noise under the pretext of repressing it.
</p>

<p>
"Let Billaud-Varennes speak!  Let Billaud-Varennes
speak!"
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre continues to protest&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Don't listen to that man!  His words are but
poisonous drivel!"
</p>

<p>
Immediately loud cries are heard&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Order!  Order!  Robespierre is not in the tribune!
Billaud-Varennes is in the tribune!  Silence!
Silence!"
</p>

<p>
And Robespierre, with a shrug of contempt,
returns to his place.
</p>

<p>
Silence being gradually restored, Billaud-Varennes
begins to speak.
</p>

<p>
"I was at the Jacobins' yesterday; the room was
crowded with men posted there to insult the National
representatives, and to calumniate the Committee of
Public Safety which devotes its days and nights to
kneading bread for you, to forging arms and raising
armies for you, to sending them forth to victory!"
</p>

<p>
A voice is heard in approval, and fresh applause
breaks out; but the gaze of the orator is fixed on
that part of the assembly called the Mountain.  He
seems to recognise some one, at whom he points
with lifted arm.
</p>

<p>
"I see yonder, on the Mountain, one of the
wretches who insulted us yesterday.  There he
stands!"
</p>

<p>
This is the signal for renewed uproar.  Several
members spring up and turn round towards the
person indicated.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, behold him!" cries Billaud.
</p>

<p>
The agitation increases.  Cries of "To the door
with him!  Turn him out!" are heard.  The man
pleads innocence, and tries to weather the storm, but
seeing the majority against him escapes as best he can,
mixes with the crowd and disappears.  Silence is with
difficulty restored among the infuriated members.
</p>

<p>
The orator continues, throwing violent and
insidious phrases broadcast among the assembly
like lighted fire-brands.  His thrusts strike nearer
home now; he accuses Robespierre openly to his
face.
</p>

<p>
"You will shudder when I tell you that the
soldiery is under the unscrupulous control of that
man who has the audacity to place at the head of
the section-men and artillery of the city the
degraded Hauriot, and that without consulting you
at all, solely according to his own will, for he listens
to no other dictates.  He has, he says, deserted the
Committees because they oppressed him.  He lies!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre rises, his lips quivering at the insult,
and attempts to reply from his place.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you lie!" continues Billaud.  "You left
us because you did not find among us either partisans,
flatterers, or accomplices in your infamous
projects against Liberty.  Your sole aim has been
to sow dissension, to disunite us that you might
attack us singly and remain in power at the head of
drunkards and debauchees, like that secretary who
stole a hundred and fifty thousand livres, and whom
you took under your wing, you, the Incorruptible,
you who make such boast of your strict virtue
and integrity!"
</p>

<p>
Laughter, mixed with some applause is heard, but
Robespierre shrugs his shoulders contemptuously at
such vulgar abuse.  Fouché, from his bench, laughs
loudly with the rest, and leaning towards his
neighbour, whispers&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Clever tactics! ... Billaud is splendid!"
</p>

<p>
The speaker, in conclusion, appeals to the patriotism
of the assembly, and implores the members to
watch over its safety.  If they do not take
energetic measures against this madman, he says, the
Convention is lost, for he only speaks of purifying
it that he may send to the scaffold all those who
stand in the way of his personal ambition.  It is,
he insists, the preservation of the Convention which
is at stake, the safety of the Republic, the salvation
of their country.
</p>

<p>
"I demand," so runs his peroration, "that the
Convention sit permanently until it has baffled the
plans of this new Catiline, whose only aim is to
cross the trench which still separates him from
supremacy by filling it with our heads!"
</p>

<p>
Thunders of applause greet Billaud-Varennes'
words; shouts, cheers, and waving of hands which
continue long after he has left the tribune.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre now leaves his seat in great agitation,
crying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is all false, and I will prove it!"
</p>

<p>
But his words are again drowned in an uproar of
voices, and cries of "Silence!  Silence!"
</p>

<p>
"I will give the traitor his answer!" exclaims
Robespierre, trying to make himself heard above
the tumult which increases at every word he utters,
so that his voice is now completely lost.  Some of
the members rush into the semicircle, forming a
living rampart round the tribune.
</p>

<p>
The din is dominated by a new voice from the
presidential chair.
</p>

<p>
"Silence, let no man speak!" it thunders forth.
</p>

<p>
It is Thuriot, who has just replaced Collot
d'Herbois in the chair.
</p>

<p>
"I demand a hearing!" vociferates the
Incorruptible, "and I will be heard!"
</p>

<p>
"You shall not!"
</p>

<p>
"I wish to speak!" cries a deputy, taking at the
same time possession of the tribune.
</p>

<p>
It is Vadier.
</p>

<p>
Thuriot rings the president's bell.
</p>

<p>
"Vadier has speech!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Vadier!  Vadier!" members exclaim from
all sides.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre continues to protest, disputing
frantically with his neighbours in his fury.
</p>

<p>
"It is infamous treachery!  Infamous!"
</p>

<p>
Again they call out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Vadier!  Silence!  Vadier!  Vadier!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Citoyens!</i>" commences Vadier&mdash;
</p>

<p>
But the speaker is interrupted by Robespierre who
furiously persists in claiming a hearing.
</p>

<p>
"Compel him to be quiet!" cries some one.
</p>

<p>
Thuriot rings his bell, and orders Robespierre to
let Vadier speak.
</p>

<p>
"Vadier is to speak!  Silence!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre once more resigns himself to his fate,
and returns to his place.
</p>

<p>
The tumult dies away in a low murmur, above
which Vadier's mellifluous voice is heard.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Citoyens!</i>" he begins, "not until the 22nd
Prairial did I open my eyes to the double-dealing
of that man who wears so many masks, and when
he cannot save one of his creatures consigns him to
the scaffold!"
</p>

<p>
Laughter and applause run round the assembly.
Thus encouraged, Vadier continues&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Only listen to him.  He will tell you, with
his usual modesty, that he is the sole defender of
Liberty, but so harassed, so discouraged, so
persecuted! ... And it is he who attacks every one
himself!"
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear!" shouts a voice.  "Excellent!
That's it, exactly!"
</p>

<p>
"He says," continues Vadier, "that he is
prevented from speaking.  Yet, strange to say, no
one ever speaks but he!"
</p>

<p>
This new sally is hailed with renewed roars of
laughter, and on every side members are convulsed
with merriment.  Robespierre writhes in his seat,
casting glances of hatred and contempt around him.
</p>

<p>
But Vadier is in the right mood, and goes on&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"This is his regular refrain: 'I am the best friend
of the Republic, and as So-and-so has looked askance
at me, So-and-so conspires against the Republic,
since I and the Republic are one!'"
</p>

<p>
Again laughter and cheers.  "Very good, Vadier!
That's it, Vadier!"
</p>

<p>
By this time the orator's ironical and facetious
allusions have served their purpose well, covering
Robespierre with ridicule, and lowering him in the
eyes of many who were still wavering, hardly daring
to join the opposition.
</p>

<p>
But Vadier, carried away by success, wanders
presently from the main point, and loses himself in
a maze of petty details.  He repeats anecdotes going
the rounds of taverns and wine-shops, speaks of
Robespierre's spies dogging the heels of the
Committee, and quotes his personal experience.  The
attention of the assembly begins to flag.  Robespierre
feels this and, taking instant advantage of it, tries to
bring the Convention back to a sense of its dignity.
</p>

<p>
"What! can you give credence to such arrant
nonsense?"
</p>

<p>
But Tallien has realised the danger, and rushing
towards the tribune cries&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I demand a hearing!  We are wandering from
the main question!"
</p>

<p>
"Fear not!  I shall return to it!" replies Robespierre,
who has now reached the semicircle, and tries
to enter the tribune by another stairway.
</p>

<p>
But several members standing on the steps push
him back.
</p>

<p>
"No! we will have Tallien!  Tallien!"
</p>

<p>
"After me!" cries Robespierre, still struggling.
</p>

<p>
"Tallien!  Tallien has speech now!"
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre climbs up by the banister with
the fury of a madman.
</p>

<p>
"Unjust, infamous judges!  Will you then only
listen to my enemies!"
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible is answered by the one cry
rising from a hundred throats.
</p>

<p>
"Silence!  Order!  Order!  Tallien!  Tallien!"
</p>

<p>
Tallien is in the tribune.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Citoyens!</i>" he breaks out in a stentorian voice.
</p>

<p>
"Hold!  Scoundrel!" shouts Robespierre, desperately.
</p>

<p>
"Have the madman arrested!" cries a voice in
the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre still does his utmost to force a passage
on the stairway.
</p>

<p>
"I will speak!  I will be heard, wretches!  I
will speak!"
</p>

<p>
The uproar increases, aggravated by Robespierre's
boisterous pertinacity.  The jingling of Thuriot's
bell at last restores order, though not without
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
The opening words of Tallien's speech are already
audible, amidst enthusiastic cheers.  Robespierre,
held firmly by some of the deputies, has
ceased his struggles, and stands on the steps in an
indignant attitude, his features twitching convulsively,
his eyes, glaring in hatred, fixed on the new speaker
who is preparing to hurl at him another shower of
insults.
</p>

<p>
"The masks are torn away!" cries Tallien.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!  Bravo!"
</p>

<p>
"It was the speech delivered yesterday in this
very hall, and repeated the same evening at the
Jacobin Club, that brought us face to face with this
unmasked tyrant, this vaunted patriot, who at the
memorable epoch of the invasion of the Tuileries
and the arrest of the King, only emerged from his
den three days after the fight..."
</p>

<p>
Sneers and hisses reach Robespierre, repeated up
to the very steps of the tribune, below which he
stands.
</p>

<p>
"This honourable citizen, who poses before the
Committee of Public Safety as champion of the
oppressed, goes home, and in the secrecy of his own
house draws up the death-lists which have stained
the altar of new-born Liberty with so much
blood!"
</p>

<p>
Renewed cheers and cries of "Hear! hear!"
rise from nearly every seat in the hall.
</p>

<p>
"But his dark designs are unveiled!" continues
Tallien.  "We shall crush the tyrant before he
has succeeded in swelling the river of blood with
which France is already inundated.  His long and
successful career of crime has made him forget his
habitual prudence.  He has betrayed himself at the
very moment of triumph, when nothing is wanting
to him but the name of king! ... I also was at
the Jacobins' yesterday, and I trembled for the
Republic when I saw the vast army that flocked to
the standard of this new Cromwell.  I invoked the
shade of Brutus, and if the Convention will not
have recourse to the sword of justice to crush this
tyrant, I am armed with a dagger that shall pierce
his heart!"
</p>

<p>
Tallien makes a movement as if to rush on
Robespierre dagger in hand; but he is arrested by a
burst of unanimous applause.  A hundred deputies
have risen and are calling out: "Bravo, Tallien!
Bravo!"
</p>

<p>
The orator, in an attitude of defiance, gazes
steadily at Robespierre, who, grasping convulsively
at the railings of the tribune, screams himself
hoarse, challenging Tallien and the deputies around,
while they answer him with abuse, shaking their
fists in his face.  It is a veritable Babel of cries,
appeals, and insults.  The President, now upstanding,
vainly tries to restore order with his bell.
</p>

<p>
At last there is a lull, of which Robespierre
attempts to take advantage.
</p>

<p>
"Vile wretches!" he cries, "would you condemn
me unheard?"
</p>

<p>
But he is answered by a telling home-thrust&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is your own Prairial law we are putting into
force!"
</p>

<p>
And applause breaks out again louder than ever.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, tired of struggling against the rough
gang on the stairway, descends to the centre of
the semicircle, and addresses the deputies of the
Mountain.
</p>

<p>
"Give me a hearing! <i>citoyens</i>!  I pray you give
me speech!"
</p>

<p>
He was answered by an ominous cry&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No! no!  The arrest!  To the votes for the arrest!"
</p>

<p>
To the votes!  The arrest!  Robespierre recoils
in terror at the fearful words.  His looks travel to
the deputies of the centre, those of the Plain as they
are called.
</p>

<p>
"It is to the Plain I address myself and not to
these traitors!" he exclaims.
</p>

<p>
But the Plain remains impassive.
</p>

<p>
Shouts are now heard from all sides, "The
arrest!  The arrest!"
</p>

<p>
Not a single voice mediates in his favour!  Not
one dares to defend his cause!  The crowd in the
gallery have remained silent and unmoved from the
very outset of the stormy scene.
</p>

<p>
A cry of anguish rises to Robespierre's lips.
"Villains!  Wretches!" he gasps.
</p>

<p>
But his voice is again drowned.
</p>

<p>
"You are the villain!  To death with the tyrant!
To death with him!  To the vote for his arrest!
To the vote for his arrest!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, now completely exhausted, makes one
supreme effort, addressing himself to Thuriot, who
is still vainly trying to restore silence with his bell.
</p>

<p>
"President of assassins, for the last time I demand
the right of speech."
</p>

<p>
"No!  No!" cry all the deputies.
</p>

<p>
"Then decree my murder...."
</p>

<p>
But his voice breaks, and the last word is lost in
a hoarse cry.
</p>

<p>
"It is Danton's blood that chokes you!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, livid at the taunt, turns to the
interrupter.
</p>

<p>
"Danton?  It is he, then, you will avenge?  Why
did you not protect him, cowards?"
</p>

<p>
Replies are hurled at him from every corner.
Had he not gagged Danton's defenders?  Now they
were going to avenge him!  Now their turn had
come!
</p>

<p>
"Did you not hound him to his death, you curs?"
shouts Robespierre, with one last cry of rage.
</p>

<p>
But a pregnant remark falls on the assembly and
hastens the end.
</p>

<p>
"It is hard work, indeed, to drag down a tyrant!"
</p>

<p>
There is no more hope for Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
This interruption recalls the Convention to the
danger that threatens them.  The turmoil is
re-doubled.  Tallien, from the tribune, which he has
not yet quitted, demands of the president that the
traitor's arrest be put to the vote.
</p>

<p>
"To the vote!  To the vote!" echoes through
the Hall.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly an unexpected incident attracts
general attention.
</p>

<p>
A deputy advances to the centre of the semi-circle:
"I demand to share my brother's fate, as I
have striven to share his nobler deeds."
</p>

<p>
It is Augustin Robespierre, who had returned to
Paris the day before, and, acting on a generous
impulse, thus offers the sacrifice of his life, a
sacrifice that is accepted out of hand.
</p>

<p>
"The arrest of the brothers Robespierre!"
</p>

<p>
"And mine!" calls out Lebas proudly, joining
the two.
</p>

<p>
"And Saint-Just!" cries a voice.
</p>

<p>
"And Couthon!"
</p>

<p>
"To the vote!  To the vote!"
</p>

<p>
The president has risen.  He will put these
arrests to the vote when silence is restored.
</p>

<p>
"Silence for the voting!  Silence!"
</p>

<p>
"Every one to his seat!"
</p>

<p>
The deputies take their respective places.  Then
in the deep and awful silence which follows, under
the strained gaze of the mob in the gallery, the
president speaks&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Citoyens</i>, I put to the vote, by standing and
sitting, the arrest of Maximilien Robespierre, of
Augustin Robespierre, of Couthon, of Saint-Just,
and of Lebas.  Let those who vote for these arrests
stand up."
</p>

<p>
A hundred deputies rise.  They are those of the
Mountain.
</p>

<p>
Seeing the men of the Plain remain motionless, a
ray of hope cheers Robespierre's despair.
</p>

<p>
Since the centre refuses to vote for his arrest,
they must be, surely, on his side.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ye at least, righteous men of the Plain!"
he pleads.
</p>

<p>
Those of the Plain start, draw themselves up, then
silently and spontaneously rise to a man!  It is the
death-blow!  The whole assembly are now standing.
The arrests are unanimously voted.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre is lost.  He totters, and nearly falls
on a bench at the foot of the tribune.
</p>

<p>
The president now officially announces the result
of the voting amidst deafening shouts of triumph.
The ushers advance to arrest Robespierre, but he
rises, livid with rage, and thrusts them aside.
</p>

<p>
The President sees this.
</p>

<p>
"Robespierre refuses to obey!  Ushers, call in the
gendarmes!"
</p>

<p>
The whole assembly echo his words, and shout:
"The gendarmes!  Bring in the gendarmes!"
</p>

<p>
The spectators in the gallery rise in their
excitement and join in the general clamour.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vive la Liberté!  Vive la Liberté!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre staggers under these crushing blows,
and shrieks in his despair&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Liberty, indeed!  She is no more!  The
triumph of those ruffians is her death-knell!"
</p>

<p>
But the guards have entered.  They surround the
accused, and push them towards the door.
Robespierre walks with head erect, and folded arms
between two gendarmes.  He does not even cast a
glance on the crowd who had hailed his entrance
with loud cheers, and who now hiss and hoot him.
The public are descending and mix with the
deputies.  The whole floor is crowded.  The
Convention-hall where a loud, incessant buzzing is all that
can be heard, resembles a gigantic beehive, for no
single voice is distinguishable in the tempestuous
clamour that follows that solemn act at last
accomplished.
</p>

<p>
A cry rises above the universal hum: "Long live
the Convention!" but is instantaneously succeeded
by another more mighty and prevailing shout:
"Long live the Republic!"
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the accused have disappeared.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
THE KNELL OF THE TOCSIN
</h3>

<p>
Urbain, who had witnessed Robespierre's signal
defeat and downfall from a seat in the gallery, ran
immediately to the Rue du Martroy, to warn Clarisse
and Thérèse that their retreat at the Hôtel de Ville
was no longer safe or secure.
</p>

<p>
The man found Clarisse in the drawing-room.
At the announcement of the fearful news, the
mother's first thought was for her son.
</p>

<p>
"Then Olivier is lost!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
In Robespierre lay her only hope, for Robespierre
alone could tear him from the grasp of the
Committee.  Now that Robespierre was vanquished and
powerless, what would become of Olivier?  Urbain,
though he himself felt apprehensive, tried to reassure
Clarisse, and at this moment Thérèse entered the
room.  She had heard all!  What!  Robespierre?
Their safety, Olivier's safety, was in the hands of
Robespierre!  She came forward, and asked in
amazement&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What! the man that was here yesterday, our
protector, was&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was he!" answered Clarisse, through
her tears, "your grandfather's former secretary."
</p>

<p>
As Thérèse, still trembling from the shock of
hearing that name, was about to answer, Clarisse
added hastily&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hush, child!  Forget all his past, and think of him
only as he was yesterday!  He is now vanquished
and fallen, and with him, alas! falls our last hope!"
</p>

<p>
Thérèse, putting aside her own fears before her
aunt's uncontrollable grief, mastered her emotion
and drove back the tears which rose to her eyes, to
dry those of Clarisse, speaking words of comfort and
hope which she herself could not feel.
</p>

<p>
"Do not give way to despair, mother!  God will
watch over us....  We have implored Him so much!"
</p>

<p>
Urbain also tried to comfort her by promising to
keep her informed of whatever happened.  There
was some talk of an insurrection of the Commune,
he told her, of an attack on the Convention by an
armed force, headed by Coffinhal, who was entirely
devoted to Robespierre.  Who could tell whether
the Incorruptible's vengeance might not be brooding!
Once rescued, he would again be all-powerful,
and change the face of affairs!
</p>

<p>
"With him, one never knows what may happen!"
continued Urbain hopefully.  "He has so many
resources, and he is, besides, so popular!"
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, worn out with grief, was, of necessity,
resigned.
</p>

<p>
"May God's will be done!" she sighed.  "I
shall wait for you here."
</p>

<p>
Urbain left them, and the two women knelt in
prayer.
</p>

<p>
The storm which had hung threateningly over
Paris all day now burst out.  Night had just set in
when streaks of lurid light shot through the
darkness, heralding a thunder-storm.  Suddenly the
sound of a bell was heard.  It grew louder and
louder, pealing a signal of alarm.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse had risen and stood erect and pale.
</p>

<p>
"The tocsin!" she gasped, and then ran to the
window, followed by Thérèse.
</p>

<p>
Troops could be discerned in the distance,
brandishing pikes and guns.
</p>

<p>
A shout reached the two women&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Down with the Convention!"
</p>

<p>
Other cries were raised.
</p>

<p>
"Call out the Sections!  Call out the Sections!
Long live the Incorruptible!"
</p>

<p>
The roll of drums was heard.  They were beating
to arms!  Horsemen galloped past in great
disorder.  Beyond doubt it was an insurrection!
</p>

<p>
Then some one knocked, and the two women turned.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" cried Clarisse.
</p>

<p>
Urbain appeared, breathless and bathed in
perspiration.
</p>

<p>
"I told you so!  Robespierre has been rescued!"
</p>

<p>
"Rescued!" exclaimed both women, unable to
conceal their joy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes! rescued on the way to the Conciergerie,
and carried in triumph to the Hôtel de Ville, where
he now is, with his brother and his friends, Lebas,
Couthon, and Saint-Just, rescued with him!  It is
war to the knife between the Communes and the
Convention.  Both parties are arming.  Coffinhal
has had to fall back on the Hôtel de Ville."
</p>

<p>
The cries outside grew louder and nearer, while
the tocsin still rang out.
</p>

<p>
"To arms!  To arms!  Long live the Incorruptible!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear?  They are stirring up the
Sections!  They will make a new attack on the
Tuileries!"
</p>

<p>
"And what is to become of us?" asked Clarisse,
"and of my son?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about your son.  But Citoyen
Robespierre has thought of you two.  It was he who
has sent me."
</p>

<p>
"To tell us?..."
</p>

<p>
"To tell you that you are no longer safe here.
The street is guarded by sectioners.  They might
come up here at any moment to fire from the
windows in case of attack.  I have orders to conduct
you to the Hôtel de Ville, where Citoyen Robespierre
has provided for your safety, but he wishes to
see you first.  You must wait for him in the
antechamber of the Commune's Council Hall, where he
is at this moment conferring with his colleagues.
He will join you as soon as he is at liberty; you
have only to follow me.  This room communicates
directly through a corridor with the Hôtel de
Ville."
</p>

<p>
"Then let us go!" said Clarisse; and, taking
Thérèse by the hand, she followed the man.
</p>

<p>
The two women crossed a suite of rooms and
corridors where officials came and went in hot
haste.  Urbain led the way, turning now and then
to direct them aright.  Presently he stopped and
said, pointing to a door&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is in here!" and he opened it.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse and Thérèse now found themselves in
a room decorated with Revolutionary emblems, the
walls covered with a greenish paper.  Two
candlesticks stood on the mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
"It was here Citoyen Robespierre told me to
bid you wait.  He is in the next room attending
a meeting in the Commune's Council Hall."
</p>

<p>
Whilst he spoke Urbain indicated a door, a little
way from that by which the two women had
entered, behind which a confused murmur of voices
was audible.
</p>

<p>
"I will go and let him know you are here," he said.
</p>

<p>
The two women were now alone.  Clarisse cast
a hasty glance round.  The apartment was very
plainly furnished; in fact, almost void of furniture.
Against a panelling between two doors on the left
was a raised platform, on which stood a large
copper-embossed table.  At the foot of the platform
were a couple of chairs and an armchair, the only
other furniture of a room which had all the gloomy
appearance of a deserted vestibule.
</p>

<p>
Just then a flash of lightning ran round the
apartment.  The two women turned.  A bust
representing the Republic appeared in the vivid and
sudden light, ghastly amid the surrounding darkness,
while a trophy surmounting the bust seemed to emit
sparks of fire.  An awful thunder-clap burst on
their ears, and screams and cries reached them
through the two windows.  Clarisse and Thérèse,
taking each other by the hand, tremblingly looked
out to see what was happening, and Clarisse
recognised the Place de la Grêve.
</p>

<p>
A large crowd, sectioners and populace, swarmed
in the square.  Cannons were being rolled hither
and thither amidst a brandishing of pikes, guns,
bayonets, and flags&mdash;all the noise and bustle of
war and riot mingling with the roar of thunder and
the flash of lightning.
</p>

<p>
"Come from the dreadful sight!" said Clarisse,
pulling Thérèse gently away.
</p>

<p>
At that moment a door opened, and as the two
women turned Robespierre appeared, attended by
Urbain.  The Incorruptible bore unmistakable
marks of the anguish of that extraordinary day on
his haggard and sunken face.
</p>

<p>
"Let us sit down!" he said, "I am worn out!"
and going towards a chair he sank down on it,
wiping great beads of perspiration from his brow.
Then he turned to Urbain.
</p>

<p>
"Open the window, it is stifling!"
</p>

<p>
He raised his eyes to Clarisse, who was standing
near.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me.... but I am almost broken down
... Come closer ... Take this chair
... Urbain has told you how things have gone with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Clarisse answered, seating herself, whilst
Thérèse, standing by her side, examined with
mixed feelings the face of the man whose terrible
name she had so lately learnt.
</p>

<p>
A painful silence ensued.  Clarisse, who burned
to question him about Olivier, hesitated in view of
the utter prostration of the man before her, whose
own head was now at stake, but Robespierre divined
her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"You are thinking of your son?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my son!  Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Alas!  I know nothing!" answered Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
Then, in a fainting voice, he told her of his useless
inquiries at the Conciergerie, of the conspiracy
of the Committee of Public Safety, who kept Olivier
hidden away&mdash;where he did not know.
</p>

<p>
"Had I won the day at the Convention I should
have delivered him&mdash;but now...."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse had risen in new terror.  Was her
martyrdom to recommence?  But Robespierre
reassured her.  He might yet be victorious in the
struggle between the Communes and the
Convention.  Once master of the Assembly, master of the
Committee, he could save Olivier.
</p>

<p>
"But if ... but if you should not succeed?"
asked Clarisse, allowing her mother's heart to
overcome her.
</p>

<p>
"He will be saved all the same!  His only
crime was that he insulted me.  At my fall he
will be looked upon as a hero.  He will be restored
to you both ... to you both," he repeated gently,
looking at Thérèse the while.
</p>

<p>
"Give me your hand, my child, and do not let
it tremble in mine....  It is on your youthful love
I shall have smiled for the last time...."
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, deeply moved by the scene, tried to
speak, but Robespierre interrupted her&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"In the meantime you must not stay here....
You must remain in the room by which you
entered...  Urbain will fetch you as soon as we
have started for the Tuileries, and will take you to
a safe retreat, where you will await the course of
events...  If I am vanquished again you are also
free...."
</p>

<p>
And looking at them sadly he added&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"For are not you also my victims?"
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, touched with pity, stopped him and
spoke words of consolation.  Why should he talk
as if everything were lost!
</p>

<p>
Alas!  Everything was nearly lost!  He had
been persuaded to hasten the attack on the Convention.
It was a trap that had been set in vengeance.
</p>

<p>
"But by whom?" asked Clarisse.
</p>

<p>
"By the dead!"
</p>

<p>
Clarisse and Thérèse were startled.
</p>

<p>
"The dead?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes ...  But you cannot understand..."
</p>

<p>
Robespierre looked straight before him as if
following the train of some fleeting thought....
Suddenly he rose.
</p>

<p>
"Enough of that, however.  Let us think of
your safety."
</p>

<p>
He then beckoned to Urbain, who advanced.
</p>

<p>
"Conduct the <i>citoyennes</i> to the next room, and
do as I have already instructed you!"
</p>

<p>
Loud cries and calls from the Commune's Council
Hall, resounded through the open door.
</p>

<p>
"Go quickly!  My friends are coming!" said
Robespierre, as he hastened the departure of the
two women, conducting them to the threshold of
the antechamber.  But his friends, Lebas, Augustin
Robespierre, Saint-Just, Couthon, Fleuriot-Lescot,
Coffinhal, Payan, Dumas, were now entering, shutting
the door sharply behind them, in a great flurry
in their impatience to be alone.
</p>

<p>
"This is hardly the moment to dally with
women!" exclaimed one of them in irritation.
</p>

<p>
It was Coffinhal, vice-president of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, and one of the most ardent promoters of the
insurrection.  Robespierre replied in a weary tone&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, have not I the right to be a
man!" and he sank into an armchair.
</p>

<p>
Just then the door opened again.  A group of
patriots entered in great excitement, speaking at the
top of their voices, and gesticulating wildly.  They
immediately surrounded Robespierre.  What was
to be done? they asked.  Were they to march on
the Tuileries?  If the attack were put off any
longer the Convention would take the offensive....
Every moment was precious!  It was really
ridiculous to beat to arms and ring the tocsin, and
then waste time discussing all night long!  What
were they waiting for, and for whom?
</p>

<p>
Some of the patriots approached the windows.
The howling crowd which, a few minutes ago
swarmed in the Place de la Grêve, had perceptibly
thinned.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre remained seated, silently wiping his
brow, irritated beyond measure by all this needless
commotion.  At last out of all patience, he started
up....  What prevented him from marching forward?
What was he waiting for?  Waiting!  He
was purely and simply waiting for Paris, the whole
of Paris, which at the voice of his friends, must rise
in his defence!  Had they come?  Yes, they had
come ... and gone again, too!  He had only
to look out on the square to convince himself of
it! ...
</p>

<p>
The groups round the windows gave signs of assent.
</p>

<p>
"They have grown tired of waiting," said
Fleuriot-Lescot.
</p>

<p>
"And it is their supper-time," observed the
Incorruptible, with a bitter smile as he sat down
again.
</p>

<p>
The sky was suddenly overclouded, and rain
poured down in torrents.
</p>

<p>
"That will help to empty the square!" observed
Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
The patriots now leant out of the windows trying
to call back those who were running to escape the
shower.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, there!  Wait a while!  Where are you
running to, cowards?  Everything is ready for the
onset!"
</p>

<p>
Lebas, who had also approached one of the
windows, stood back discouraged.
</p>

<p>
"They are deserting us by hundreds!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
The patriots again eagerly pressed Robespierre.
There was all the more reason for them to march
on the Tuileries at once.
</p>

<p>
"Decide, for goodness' sake!" said Coffinhal;
"enough time has been lost already!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre rose from his seat, and answered
wearily&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Very well! let us go!  And God grant that the
defenders of the Convention be as valiant as ours!"
he added in bitter sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
"Before starting," suggested Payan, "you had
better sign this last proclamation.  It will serve to
rouse the sectioners of the Pignes Quarter."
</p>

<p>
"Very well!  Give it to me!"
</p>

<p>
Lebas handed him a pen.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre wrote the first letters of his name,
Rob....
</p>

<p>
He stopped suddenly.  A distant sound, as of a
trumpet-call, rang out in fearful warning.  They
look at each other anxiously.  What could it be?
</p>

<p>
A man ran in upon them, in breathless haste.  It
was Didier, Robespierre's agent.
</p>

<p>
"The attack!" he panted.  "The troops of the
Convention are coming upon us, led by Barras!"
</p>

<p>
"But what does it all mean?" they cried wildly.
"What has happened?"
</p>

<p>
There was not a moment to lose!  The assailants
were advancing in double column; Leonard Bourdon
reading by the light of the torches the decree of
the Convention declaring the insurgents outlaws.
Yes, outlaws!  Anybody was at liberty to fire on
them!
</p>

<p>
"But the people," asked Lebas, "the people are
with us?"
</p>

<p>
No! the people were no longer with the insurgents.
They had turned back, and were following
the assailants with loud cheers.  Robespierre and
his friends could even then hear their deafening
shouts and threats.
</p>

<p>
"Hark!  Do you hear them?" said Didier.
"They are on the quay!"
</p>

<p>
Now followed a regular panic.  The maddest
proposals succeeded each other.  They ought to
fall back on to the Faubourg! said one.  No, to
the arsenal! suggested another.
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre resolutely and authoritatively
interposed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It would be absolute madness!  Prepare yourselves
for the fight!  Get the guns ready.  There
are artillerymen enough in the square to shoot
them all down."
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  That is the best plan!  The Incorruptible
is right."
</p>

<p>
Coffinhal ran to the window to give a signal to
the gunners.  A loud cry of "Long live the
Republic!" answered him.  Robespierre
recommended prudence to Coffinhal.  He must instruct
the gunners to let the enemy first reach the square,
and then at close quarters fire on them, while
Bourdon would be reading the decree.
</p>

<p>
Every one approved this plan, and the order was
repeated to Coffinhal.  Prudence and self-possession
were necessary.  Didier, on being questioned,
assured them that the cannon still commanded the
square.  They were a match for any assailants!
Robespierre continued to give orders.  The patriots
in the next room, the General Council Chamber,
must be informed of the plan.  Lebas went to open
the door, but started back on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"The room is empty!" he cried.  "The cowards! they
have fled!"
</p>

<p>
They looked at each other in dumb amazement.
The men on watch at the windows now announced
that the assailants were in sight.  They could discern
the gleam of torches, but the gunners had not moved.
</p>

<p>
Again that brazen trumpet-call fell ominously on
their ears, accompanied by the low rumbling of
distant thunder.  A sudden roll of drums burst out,
and then all was hushed.  The sound of a voice,
coming up from the square in solemn, measured
tones, broke upon the silence.
</p>

<p>
"In the name of the French Republic, the
National Convention decrees Robespierre and all
those who have taken part in the rebellion to be
out of law."
</p>

<p>
A vague, indistinct murmur now arose from the square.
</p>

<p>
The voice continued with startling resonance&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Citoyens!</i> the Convention command you to
make way for us!"
</p>

<p>
Robespierre and his friends were leaning out of
the windows breathless with suspense, their eyes
fastened on the artillery.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't they fire?" said Coffinhal.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre leant on a bar of the window, his
hands clenched over it, his face pale, perspiration
trickling down his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you fire at them, you dolts!"
</p>

<p>
Ah! they were getting their guns ready; they
would fire now!
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden movement of relief and
hopefulness that lasted only for a moment and
then gave place to horror.
</p>

<p>
The sectioners had turned their cannon against
the Hôtel de Ville!
</p>

<p>
One cry, the despairing cry of the vanquished,
echoed through the room.
</p>

<p>
"We are betrayed!  <i>Sauve qui peut!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Then followed an indescribable scene of panic.
All was irreparably lost.  Defeat, merciless and
sanguinary, stared them in the face.  Cries and
shouts came up from the square, but one cry rose
above all.
</p>

<p>
"<i>En avant!</i>  Forward!"
</p>

<p>
Drums beat the charge.
</p>

<p>
Some ran to the doors, others to the windows to
get upon the roof.  Augustin Robespierre already
on the ledge of one of the windows, prepared to
escape by the cornice.  His foot slipped and he fell
on to the pavement amidst derisive shouts.
</p>

<p>
"They shall not have me alive!" cried Lebas,
drawing two pistols from his belt; and he placed
one on the table near Robespierre, who had fallen
prostrate on a chair.
</p>

<p>
"That is for you, Robespierre!  Adieu!" and
he rushed put.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre looked at the pistol, and pushed it
aside with an expression of utter weariness.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I?  Let death come as it pleases!"
</p>

<p>
Just then a door opened and Clarisse, breathless
with fear, rushed in, clasping Thérèse tightly by
the hand.  Fearful and threatening sounds entered
with her through the open door.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre turned and saw her.
</p>

<p>
"Unhappy woman!  Not gone yet!"
</p>

<p>
Almost mad with terror, she told him that they
could not escape, the assailants were at their heels.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre wildly seized the pistol from the
table and pointed to the other exit.
</p>

<p>
"Fly that way!  I will kill the first to gain time!"
</p>

<p>
Clarisse dragged Thérèse towards the door, but
recoiled with a terrified shriek.  Loud shouts were
heard coming that way.  Robespierre rushed forward
and pushed them towards another door opposite.
</p>

<p>
"This way, then!  Fly! for pity's sake, fly!"
</p>

<p>
Clarisse and Thérèse crossed over to the other
exit.  But through the door they had just left a
fearful cry entered, and nailed them to the spot.
</p>

<p>
"This way!  Follow me!"
</p>

<p>
It was Olivier's voice!  Robespierre recognised it
also, and was struck dumb with horror!  All three
fastened their eyes on the door in agonised suspense.
</p>

<p>
Olivier, all dishevelled, his clothes in disorder,
appeared on the threshold.  His eyes met
Robespierre's, who was standing near the platform.  He
rushed on him, pistol in his hand, exclaiming&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ah! villain.  You will kill no one else, now!"
and was about to fire, but Clarisse threw herself on
him, and held his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! you, Olivier! you of all the world!  Oh! horror!"
</p>

<p>
And she tore the pistol from his grasp and flung
it away.  He looked first at her, then at Thérèse,
bewildered at their presence.  Robespierre, still
grasping his pistol, silently watched the scene.  His
son's act was his death-blow.  Deliberately he turned
the muzzle of the weapon towards himself.
</p>

<p>
"I shall kill no one else ... but myself!" he
sighed, and with the word he pulled the trigger and
fell wounded on the steps of the platform.  The
bullet had broken his jaw.
</p>

<p>
Clarisse, beside herself at this double shock,
rushed to Robespierre's side and attempted to staunch
the blood flowing from his wound.  As he fell, some
drops of blood splashed on the half-signed proclamation,
and added a ghastly flourish to the initial
letters R...o...b...
</p>

<p>
Thérèse, standing near Olivier, was weeping bitterly
and telling him of the efforts Robespierre had
made to save them all.
</p>

<p>
"He?" cried Olivier, still incredulous.
</p>

<p>
The room filled rapidly from every side with the
assailants armed with pikes, swords, knives, and
muskets.  They rushed in, screaming and shouting
"Victory!  Victory!"  But all drew back on seeing
Robespierre stretched on the ground, bathed in
blood.  A national representative ran to the window
and announced the news to the crowd swarming in
the Place de la Grêve.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Citoyens!</i> the tyrant has shot himself!  The
tyrant has forestalled the law!  Long live the
Convention!"
</p>

<p>
Cries of "Long live the Convention!" re-echoed
from the square, and were taken up and repeated
from afar, till they gradually died in the distance.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre, raising himself with Clarisse's aid,
looked around for Olivier and Thérèse among the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
"At all events, the child is saved and you also,"
he said....  "Let me not pass away without your
forgiveness!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes!  I forgive you!" Clarisse murmured
amidst her tears.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you!" he answered feebly, and fell
back fainting.
</p>

<p>
A rough, commanding voice broke in on Clarisse's grief.
</p>

<p>
"Take him up!"
</p>

<p>
Clarisse still remained, kneeling, but they pushed
her aside.
</p>

<p>
"Now then!  Get out of the way!"
</p>

<p>
She rose with difficulty, every limb trembling,
and escaped from the crowd with Thérèse and
Olivier through an open door.  Some men advanced to
carry Robespierre away, who looked already like a
corpse, with his eyes closed, and the blood gushing
through his lips.  One man held his head, another
his legs, and thus the ghastly burden was carried
through the crowd of assailants, who stood aside to
make way for it.  Clarisse, standing in one of the
doorways as the gloomy procession passed, clung to
her son, imploring his pity.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! pardon him!  Do you too pardon him!
I beg you, pardon him!"
</p>

<p>
"Make room for the Incorruptible!" shouted a
voice in ribald mockery.
</p>

<p>
They shrunk back, but Clarisse all the while
passionately entreated her son to pardon Robespierre.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hear me, my son, I implore you!  Say that
you forgive him!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mother, I forgive him, and may God have
mercy on him!" Olivier murmured, casting a long
look after the grim procession till it was lost to
sight.
</p>

<p>
Olivier then turned to his mother and his fiancée.
</p>

<p>
"Now, let us get away from here!" he says.
</p>

<p>
"Is it really true?  Are you free?" asked Clarisse.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, quite free!  I will tell you all about it
presently.  But we must secure a passport if we
want to leave Paris....  Let us make haste!"
</p>

<p>
The two women passed out under Olivier's protection,
and descended the Hôtel de Ville's grand
staircase through the crowd, which followed fallen
Robespierre with cries of "Victory!  Victory!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
DEATH'S KINDLY VEIL
</h3>

<p>
Robespierre has thus been vanquished for the
second time!
</p>

<p>
Where will they take him?  To the Tuileries,
to the Convention, into the very midst of the
victorious National Assembly, where the dying despot
is to be exposed to the raillery of the populace,
before being carried to the scaffold.  Robespierre is
laid down in the courtyard of the Hôtel de Ville,
and placed with infinite care on a litter.  They lift
his head and bind up his wound, for he must live
long enough to receive the final retribution.  The
bullet has but half robbed the scaffold of its prey.
</p>

<p>
Artillerymen now come forward, and take him
up again, but Robespierre, still unconscious, knows
nothing of what is passing round him.  They lift
the wreck of what was once the Incorruptible and
continue their way.  Saint-Just walks in the rear
between two gendarmes, his hands bound behind
him, very pale, with head erect, and perfectly
indifferent to the insults hurled at him&mdash;the only one
of his allies who is with Robespierre in the hour
of defeat.  The others are either dead, hidden or
fled.  But their turn will come, for hot search is
afoot for the cowards and fugitives.
</p>

<p>
The gloomy <i>cortège</i> crosses the Place de la Grêve,
and moves in the direction of the quay, on its way
to the Tuileries, beneath a cloudless sky that smiles
after the rain, as the stars are gradually effaced
by the first gleams of dawn.  It is three o'clock.
The <i>cortège</i> is followed by a curious and gaping
crowd.  Passers-by stop and ask, "What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Robespierre, who is wounded.  They are taking
him to the Convention."
</p>

<p>
Then the inquirers' faces light up with joy.
</p>

<p>
"It is all over, then! ... The tyrant is going
to die! ... There will be no more scaffold!"
</p>

<p>
And the passers-by joined the crowd.
</p>

<p>
But at the Convention the order had been given
that the "monster" was not to be received.  Even
a captive and almost a corpse, they will not allow
Robespierre again to cross the threshold, once he
has been banished from their midst.  The Incorruptible,
as an outlaw, belongs to justice only.  So
the wounded man is taken up and laid at the foot of
the grand staircase leading to the Committee of
Public Safety.
</p>

<p>
There, on the very spot where, two days before,
Robespierre, returning from the Conciergerie, hurled
defiance at Billaud-Varennes, he now lies on a litter,
vanquished, ruined, gasping out his life!
</p>

<p>
A peremptory order is given, and flies from mouth
to mouth.  Robespierre is to be transported to the
Committee's waiting-room.  Saint-Just walks in
front now, with Dumas, President of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, who has been discovered hidden in
a corner of the Hôtel de Ville, and several others
whose arrest and arrival is also announced.
</p>

<p>
The litter is carried into the room.  Robespierre
still unconscious is lifted out and laid on a table, and
his head is pillowed on a deal box, containing
samples of munition bread.  His shirt, loosened at
the neck, and leaving the throat bare, is covered
with blood which still flows freely from the mutilated
jaw.  The sky-blue coat is soiled and torn, the
nankeen breeches, the white stockings, washed and
ironed by Cornélie Duplay, are now all stained and
disfigured.
</p>

<p>
The Incorruptible is a mutilated mass, but a
living mass, still breathing and still suffering.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre has opened his eyes; he raises his
right hand, groping instinctively for his handkerchief,
wishing to wipe his mouth.  His trembling fingers
come in contact with a white leather pistol-case,
which he lifts to his lips to staunch the blood.  By
an irony of fate the case bears the inscription&mdash;"<i>The
Great Monarch; Lecourt, manufacturer to the King</i>."
</p>

<p>
Robespierre appears to revive.  He looks round,
and his eyes fall on Saint-Just and Dumas, side by
side in the recess of one of the windows, shrugging
their shoulders at the rudeness of the people who
pass through the room and stare at them as if they
were curiosities.  The insults are now directed
against Robespierre, who turns away:&mdash;"There is
fallen majesty for you!" exclaims one....
"Majesty laid low," says another....  "With his
bandages he looks like a mummy or a nun!"
... "Yes, a nun with her head-gear awry!" ... "He
is thinking of his Supreme Being!  It's just the
right moment!"
</p>

<p>
But Robespierre, under this railing clamour and
abuse, does not stir.  There he lies, stretched out
motionless, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, the very
embodiment of silent scorn.  Slowly and without a
word, he drinks the cup of bitterness; he will drink
it so, to the very dregs.  A conqueror, he would
have been to them a god; vanquished, they nail
him to the pillory.  Such is the constant perfidy of
human nature!  And yet he had been so near
success, so near!  If the Convention had not proved
so cowardly at the sitting, had not succumbed
directly before Tallien's attack! ... If they had
but let him speak!  If they had allowed him to
defend himself!  But the plot had been too well laid.
Then Robespierre's thoughts wander to the other
wretches, the Communes, the cowards on whom he
had counted, the vile traitors and base deserters!
</p>

<p>
His bitter meditations are suddenly cut short by a
shooting pain in the knee, which runs through him
like a knife.  It is his garter, which is too tightly
drawn.  He raises himself and stretches out his
hand to undo it, but his strength fails, and he falls
back again.  Suddenly he feels some one gently
loosening it.  He lifts himself again and bends
forward.  Can he be dreaming?  That young man
... yes, it is Olivier! ... Olivier, himself!
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you, my ... thank you, my
... thank you, monsieur!" he says hastily.
</p>

<p>
He is on the point of saying, "my son!" but
has strength enough left to recollect himself.  No!
Olivier must never know the secret of his birth,
never, never!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre falls back again.  The emotion is
too much for him, and he faints away.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it is Olivier, who has just obtained from the
Committee a passport for his mother, his <i>fiancée</i>,
and himself.  Crossing the waiting-room he had
seen Robespierre stretched out on the table in front
of him.  Touched with pity at his vain and painful
attempts to undo the garter, he had come to his
assistance.
</p>

<p>
Olivier now leaves the Committee of Public
Safety to rejoin Clarisse and Thérèse, who are
waiting for him in the Tuileries Gardens, and overcome
with fatigue have sat down on a bench, and seeing
them in the distance hastens his steps.
</p>

<p>
"I have the passport!" he exclaims.
</p>

<p>
"Then let us go, and lose no time!" Clarisse
answers; "let us return to Montmorency, at once!
I long to leave the city of woe and misery."
</p>

<p>
"We cannot go yet," replies Olivier.  "The
passport must bear the stamp of the Committee of
General Security to be of any use, and I must
present myself before the Committee at three o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"Then, what are we to do?  Where shall we
go?" asks Clarisse wearily.
</p>

<p>
"We can only go to the Rue du Rocher, to
Leonard's landlady.  She will receive me with open
arms, you will see, now she has no longer
Robespierre to fear."
</p>

<p>
It is five o'clock, and day has just dawned.
The air is soft and fresh, the sky above of sapphire
blue; the trees, the streets, the very houses, seem
smiling with renewed life, after the refreshing
shower.
</p>

<p>
In this brightening dawn Robespierre is being
taken to the Conciergerie, for the Committee of
Public Safety have altered their decision.  Robespierre
and his accomplices, now found and arrested,
are to be confined in the Conciergerie in order
to undergo the formality of identification.  From
thence they are to be taken to the scaffold without
trial or judgment, as outlaws.
</p>

<p>
So Robespierre is replaced on the litter, followed
by the gaping crowd.  He sleeps the whole way,
lulled by the measured tread of the men who carry
him, and only awakes to find himself in a narrow
cell, in charge of a gendarme.
</p>

<p>
"Can I write?" he asks.
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
"Where am I?"
</p>

<p>
"At the Conciergerie."
</p>

<p>
His eyes flash for a second.  He looks round
uneasily and repeats&mdash;"At the Conciergerie!  In
what part of the Conciergerie?"
</p>

<p>
"Between the Queen's cell and the Girondins' Chapel."
</p>

<p>
Between his victims!  He is between his
victims!  The fearful warning on the prison walls
passes again before his eyes: "Robespierre, your
hour will come!..."  The dead were right!
If he had done away with the guillotine in time,
he would perhaps not be there, himself a victim of
the Terror he had let loose!  But he could not!
No, he could not, it was too soon....  He would
have been engulfed in the turmoil, just the
same! ... In continuing the Revolutionary Tribunal, in
keeping the executioner at his post, he was merely
protecting his own head!
</p>

<p>
His mind is flooded with ideas....  He is,
dreaming vaguely, his dim eyes fixed on the low
ceiling of his cell....  His youth smiles at him
through the mist of years, every detail of the past
comes back to him in clear and lucid vision.
</p>

<p>
He sees Clarisse seated at her harpsichord,
he is turning over the leaves of her music ... but
the vision trembles, and then fades away.  Fever
gradually rises to his brain, takes entire possession
of him, and deadens his senses, so that he is
completely unconscious, and when Fouquier-Tinville,
his creature of the Revolutionary Tribunal,
his accomplice in the days of bloodshed, comes
forward to identify him, he does not recognise his
voice.
</p>

<p>
The end is now approaching.  At five in the
afternoon the gendarmes come to conduct Robespierre
to the scaffold.  The Convention has decreed
that for this occasion the guillotine shall be
erected at the Place de la Révolution.  Robespierre
is borne on the litter through the crowd of prisoners,
the victims of his hatred and his laws, and when the
dying man has passed the threshold they breathe
again.  With him death departs and new life comes in.
</p>

<p>
The tumbril is waiting in the courtyard,
surrounded by a crowd of <i>sans-culottes</i> and Mænads,
and hundreds of spectators eager to witness the
startling spectacle, are swarming in the streets to
hoot and abuse Robespierre as heartily as they had
cheered and applauded him at the Fête of the
Supreme Being!  To effect this startling change one
sitting of the Convention has sufficed!
</p>

<p>
Robespierre is now in sight.  This is the signal
for the wildest uproar.  He is seated on a bench in
the first tumbril, and fastened against the bars of
the cart to keep him from falling.  The fresh air
has revived him; he allows them to do as they
please, looking on in silent scorn.  Others of the
condemned are placed in the same tumbril: Augustin
Robespierre, Saint-Just, Dumas the president,
Hauriot, and Couthon.  The two last are seated right
and left of Robespierre.  Four other carts follow,
equally loaded.  The condemned number twenty-two
in all.
</p>

<p>
Now Robespierre's <i>via dolorosa</i> begins.
</p>

<p>
Abuse and insults rain down on them in torrents,
covering Robespierre and his accomplices with
ignominy.
</p>

<p>
The ghastly procession crosses the Pont-au-Change,
the Quay de la Mégisserie, and passing
the Rue de la Monnaie it enters the Rue Saint-Honoré.
</p>

<p>
Curses are heard mingling with the shrieks of the
rabble, for among the crowd there are many victims
of the Terror, widows and orphans conjuring up the
memory of all their anguish, all the drama of the
guillotine, the work of the Incorruptible.
</p>

<p>
A woman clutches at the tumbril in which Robespierre
sits, a woman whose two children had been
torn from her by the Prairial law.
</p>

<p>
"Monster!" she cries, "vile monster! in the
name of all mothers, I curse you to hell!"
</p>

<p>
The crowd following the <i>cortège</i> grows denser as
it proceeds.  It is <i>Decadi</i>, the Republican Sunday.
All Paris is out of doors.  The windows and
balconies are thronged with men and women in festal
attire, pressing forward to see the procession file
past, and showering down shouts of joy and triumph,
for the passing of those tumbrils means also the
passing away of the reign of Terror.
</p>

<p>
Robespierre continues his dreadful way, his eyes
fixed and glassy, his face wrapped in the bandage
which holds his jaw together, and partly hides it like
some ghastly mask.  By his side sits Hauriot, livid
and terrified, covered with the mud and filth of the
sewer into which he had fallen.  Couthon and
Augustin Robespierre, pitifully mutilated, are lying
at the bottom of the cart.  Saint-Just alone stands
erect, his hands bound, and retains his scornful air.
</p>

<p>
The tumbrils enter the Rue Saint-Honoré near
the Jacobin Club, where two days before the
Incorruptible reigned supreme.  The martyrdom is not
over.  They are before the house of the Duplays.
</p>

<p>
The <i>cortège</i> stops.
</p>

<p>
At a given signal a child dips a broom in a pail
of blood, and sprinkles the front door.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  Robespierre, here is your cavern branded
with the blood of your victims!" cries a voice.
</p>

<p>
A plaintive howl is heard from behind the blood-smeared
door.  It is Blount, who has scented his
master.  Robespierre shuts his eyes but it is
useless, for he can hear!
</p>

<p>
People question each other in the crowd.
Where are the Duplays?  In prison!  The father
at Plessis, the mother at Sainte-Pilagie with her
young son.  Lebas has killed himself!  His body
is there in one of the carts.  As to the daughters,
they have fled, most probably.
</p>

<p>
But now for the guillotine!
</p>

<p>
The <i>cortège</i> continues its way, while the heart-rending
moans of Blount can still be heard in the
distance.  That cry of the faithful dog, recognising
his master and calling to him, is the last adieu to
Robespierre from his recent home.
</p>

<p>
The first tumbril is already at the top of the Rue
Saint-Florentin.  A man turns out of the street and
runs in the direction of the Rue de la Révolution.
</p>

<p>
The crowd cry after him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, there! will you not see the Incorruptible's
head cut off?  Stop! stop!  Don't be so
chicken-hearted!"
</p>

<p>
But the man is already far away.  It is Olivier,
returning from the Committee of General Security,
where he had at last succeeded in having his passport
countersigned, after endless trouble.  He tries
to cross the Rue Saint-Honoré, but the crowd fills
the street; so he retraces his steps, followed the
Jardin des Tuileries, and reaches the Rue
Saint-Florentin, at the very moment when the tumbrils
are at hand.
</p>

<p>
Away from them he hurries, towards the Rue de
Rocher, where Clarisse and Thérèse are impatiently
awaiting him in their room.  The landlady, anxious
to be taken back to favour, has been worrying them
with officious attention since the morning.
</p>

<p>
Olivier bursts in upon them eagerly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It's done!  Now we can start!  Is the carriage
ready?"
</p>

<p>
The widow Beaugrand is in despair.
</p>

<p>
"Then you have decided to go?  Will you not
wait until to-morrow?  I have such a nice supper
prepared!"
</p>

<p>
Olivier grows impatient.  Clarisse and Thérèse
get ready to start.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right!  Everything is arranged," says
the landlady.  "The carriage has been ordered, and
is just two steps from here."
</p>

<p>
She hastens downstairs, followed by Olivier and
the two women, who wait outside.  The street is
deserted.  The day melts in a soft twilight.  Stars
already twinkle in the cloudless sky.  Light, happy
laughter comes from a balcony opposite, the echo
of childish merriment, which soon ceases with the
closing of a door.
</p>

<p>
The carriage has arrived, an open <i>char-à-banc</i>
with four seats.  Olivier helps his mother and his
<i>fiancée</i> in, then climbs up on the box beside the
driver.
</p>

<p>
"To Montmorency!  And take the shortest cut!"
</p>

<p>
The carriage rolls away amidst the farewells and
good wishes of the widow Beaugrand.  However,
at the end of the Rue du Rocher it stops suddenly
and draws up to the side of the road.  Two carts
are coming at full gallop, driven by men in red
nightcaps.  Olivier asks impatiently&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter now?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the dead bodies of the condemned, citoyen;
they are taking them to the Cemetery des Errancy.
Ah! now, the Incorruptible can kill no more!"
</p>

<p>
The two women have heard!
</p>

<p>
Clarisse and Thérèse fall on their knees, their
hands clapped, and their eyes lifted in prayer.
Olivier bares his head.  The carts are passing.
Clarisse and Thérèse make the sign of the cross.
Olivier, pale with emotion, follows their example,
turning towards Thérèse and his mother, whose
eyes dwell with strange emotion on his face.  Her
tear-dimmed gaze is full of mute thanksgiving, the
secret of which Olivier will never know.
